We absolutely loved it and anticipate seeing it repeatedly.  We actually wore out the cassette years back, so we also purchased this same product on cd.  Best purchase we made out of all!  Would purchase on dvd if we could find one.","1":"Believe me when I tell you that you will receive a blessing watching this video of the Cathedral Quartet.  They bring back most of the singers that were ever in their group and it is a really great VHS.","2":"I have seen X live many times, both in the early days and their more recent reunion shows. Trust me when I say this: they never disappoint as a live band! This DVD document of a show on their home turf of LA is a dream come true. Can't wait.","7":"The little ones love this","8":"Good songs. The DVD is a little boring.","9":"The DVD came in great condition and provided lots of entertaining minutes of reliving the past.  Definitely worth the money.","10":"Watch this and learn how we ended up in the state we are in as a dying country.","11":"REALLY ENJOYED","12":"excellent as usual","13":"A great read.  So much historical info.\n\nThank you,","14":"Should be a must read","15":"Well done video with important information that Americans should know.","16":"While there was a lot of information in this piece (some of it coming at your faster than a freight train, another down side of the video), there is no doubt that it was produced as right-wing propaganda, which means I'm not able to use it as I hoped (for my children's home schooling). One large section of the video is a series of quotes from historical U. S. leaders, mentioning God and\/or the Bible -- the quotes are simply inserted without any background or even a common-ground to relate each of them.","18":"Haters will say this is biased, that the founding fathers were not christians, or that they were deists...and maybe that's true for some of the ff. But this documentary is very informative. Our nation started as something it is most certainly not anymore. And we are falling. This movie gives insight as to why.","19":"What a great video that gives the early history of our great country!  I'd highly recommend this to everyone - especially for school children that are not learning the history of our country.","21":"I found this dvd put together with historical facts and visuals that kept my interest in the issues discussed. would recommend 6-12 grade classes watching this.","22":"Well done!  I will definitely be showing this to my children when they get a little older.  This is the documentary you will never see in our public school system these days.  Ironically, it is the one documentary that you should have to see before you graduate.  It is amazing how far our country has fallen from the original intentions of our Founding Fathers.  This is a great reminder of what liberalism and political correctness has done to the United States of America.","23":"Really excellent piece of work showing the beliefs of the founding fathers and what is happening now to our nation.","28":"Being a huge fan of this classic, I own dozens of versions and this one  adds a nice variety.  The twists and changes to this timeless story truly  do justice to the original and the performances, for the most part, are  stellar.  If you're looking for the same feel good movie but in a new  setting, this one's for you.","29":"as described","30":"A good movie with morals","31":"Love the movie.","32":"This TV movie brought back fond memories of the first time my wife and I watched it in the late 70's. Henry Winkler did a great job with the character of an American Scrooge. It was radical change from the Fonz.","33":"More of a 'modern' version of the classic.  I didn't think I'd be impressed when my parents took this out but I gave it a try and have to say...what a great adaptation.  The cast was great, Winkler was exceptional.  I was very happy to see this on Amazon and happened to catch it when the price went way down so I snapped it up.  Great timeless classic...and Winkler really surprised me with his portrayal.","34":"Perfect!","35":"A rare classic,  a good movie.","36":"The Christmas Carol is my all time favorite story.  I haven't found a version that I haven't disliked yet.  This one was no exception.  Henry Winkler did an awesome joy portraying the Scrooge like character.","37":"Heard about this movie saw it years ago. Husband wanted to see it, I just added it to my christmas movie collection.","38":"Great movie thank you !!!","39":"Well made Christmas movie. It's a little slow but sweet natured.","40":"Great spin on the Classic Christmas Story by the master C. Dickens...","41":"Great product, fast shipping","42":"We loved it. Henry Winkler is a great actor and we missed it not being on TV this year, so we had to buy it for our collection.  Thanks","43":"This movie is better than it ought to be. Authentic settings and costuming for America 1930's Depression Era. The Scrooge character really does a good changeover. In old TV 4:5 ratio.","44":"Good movie","45":"OK","46":"Love this movie it is a twist from the Original!","47":"great adaptation of dickens classic Henry winkler is a gifted actor","48":"I have been looking for this dvd for a long time. Love Henry Winkler in the movie","49":"There are MANY versions of \"A Christmas Carol\" out there. In my humble opinion, this feature length story, set in America during the Great Depression, starring Henry Winkler in the \"Scrooge\" role, is BY FAR the finest interpretation of the classic story. It's as Dickens would have written if he had lived in America in the 1930's. The human drama is REAL, and the joyful ending brings Dickens' ending into the American culture. BIG smile !","50":"I've watching this movie for several Christmas seasons and I just love it!","51":"this is my all time fav christmas movie.  if you haven't seen this version you need to check it out at least once in your life.","52":"Certainly not the best or my favorite but still very enjoyable!","53":"Always loved this version of a Christmas Carol.","54":"Henry Winkler, cute as ever.  This movie is a nice addition to my Christmas Carol collection.","55":"Good movie. Good buy.","56":"good","57":"Found \"An American Christmas Carol\" to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it didn't rise to the level of the film versions of the Dickens Christmas Carol, but it was worth watching.","58":"Fantastic movie","59":"Henry Winkler was great in this.","60":"Is among my favorite updated versions of A Christmas Carol.","61":"I've always loved watching \"American Christmas Carol\". Tradition in our family.","62":"This movie is really good,I loved it","63":"It was OK but not the best.","64":"Wonderful movie. Well made and Henry Winkler was amazing in this roll.","65":"My husband and I were looking for a Christmas movie to watch and stumbled across this one randomly. We chose it because of Henry Winkler. We were both pleasanly surprised at how much we liked it. It was a nice update on the classic story, even though it's \"old\" now. We both recommend it.","66":"Great","67":"Hate to say it, but this is an example of a re-make falling short of the mark.","68":"A great contemporary perspective of A Christmas Carol!","69":"Great price, great quality, will buy from seller again","71":"Thought it was a very good interpretation of A Christmas Carol. Henry Winkler did a good job as Mr. Slate (Scrooge). I would recommend this movie if you are a fan.","72":"did not like","73":"It was an ok adaptation, but I still prefer the original version.","74":"I was getting tired of the same holiday movies that run every day at christmas.  I love this old movie.  Great to watch during the holidays!!  Me & my husband watched it on Christmas Eve.","75":"Not what I expected.  Very low budget.","76":"Great movie","77":"Very well done!  Henry Winkler performed flawlessly!","78":"Very good. The best thing Henry Winkler EVER did.","79":"good variation of a theme.","80":"A sweet movie with Henry Winkler \"The Christmas Carol\" genre.","81":"This is a classic scrooge movie but set in the 30's and I love Henry Winkler!","82":"Excellent inspiring movie!!!","83":"Enjoyed this different twist to Dicken's tale.","84":"Interesting adaption of the scrooge story.","85":"Good take off on the original.","86":"Liked","87":"always was a good movie","88":"I am a Henery Winkler fan","89":"Pathetic reproduction of the Dickens classic. Interesting that the movie is particularly concerned with  the problem of people who lose their possessions to money lenders--corporations not unlike the ones which own directly or indirectly the media which present us with the American version of the Christmas carol.","90":"I love this movie. Brings back memories to when I first saw it. Henry Winkler is wonderful as an American \"Scrooge\". It is set during the Depression of the 1930s. And \"tiny Tim\" is a young boy who has been hit with polio.","91":"Fleur bleu.","92":"Worth watching if you like dickens","93":"Since I love Henry Winkler this is an easy one to enjoy. Henry is such a great actor.","94":"It's okay","95":"Slow moving. Boring.  Never finished it.","96":"I thought it was a good Christmas movie.","97":"Just really great! I never knew the Fonze played Scrooge. Well, the characters' names are all different, there's no nephew, the ghost of Christmas future talks, but the basic story line is the same old wonderful classic. I really enjoyed this movie and I think you will too!","98":"It was great seeing this again. I remember when it first came out. Henry Winkler was still the Fonz. I remember how strange it was seeing him in this role. A great take on Mr. Dickens classic story.","99":"This is your classic Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler playing Scrooge. He was actually fairly young when he played this part. They did a great job making him look like an old man. Of course, Henry did a great job with the acting portion. The ending in this take was a little unbelievable as Scroodge was very old by that time. Still a very uplifting film with a good lesson for life.","100":"Fine acting by Henry Winkler and supporting cast.  Nice version of the many films that have been made of A Christmas Carol.","101":"Slowwwwwwww","102":"Wife liked it!  Old TV Special!","103":"Very good movie","104":"For fans of the Dickens story this remains fresh today! For fans of Henry Winkler it delivers with his Fonzi good looks and particular method of acting - very focused and sharp with movement and dialogue. Great watch for the Happy Days familiar.","105":"well made, good acting for all","106":"enjoyed another version of \"The Christmas Carol\", story still comes through","107":"Good remake of the classic","109":"While Winkler's make up job is dated and not realistic this version is well done . A nice story . So glad we found it on Amazon after seeing it back on 1979 on TV","110":"Such phoney acting!","111":"Excellent story that reminds you - to love yourself and other as God\/Jesus loves you.","112":"Good story for the family, and a great message.","113":"Love Henry Winkler! He's a convincing \"Scrooge\" with a meltable heart. Really liked the way the story wrote in the not-so-ghostly \"ghosts\" of past, present and future Christmases. And we just love a happy ending, don't we?","114":"it was a good movie but we still like the old one best.","115":"I saw this as TV movie.\nIt is very good story based on A Christmas Carol set in Depression era.\nHenry Winkler does excellent Acting.\nWonderful Christmas movie.","116":"Good as it gets for a modern twist to this 1800's tale.","117":"great show","118":"it was alright","119":"Good movie.","120":"Henry Winkler does a great job playing Slade.  He is just plan mean and cold hearted.  Rich with nothing to show for it.  Then the usual transformation.\n\nThe auction was a new twist adding humor in an un-expected scene.  Winkler ends up being so much fun at the end of the movie making turning it into a comedy.\n\nI'll watch this again.","121":"good movie","122":"Henry Winkler did a great job in this American rendition of a classic.","123":"This Is a Great Holiday Movie,,, Outstanding,,,, Not To Be Miss'ed","124":"ok","125":"still love to watch this movie each Christmas season.","126":"Good movie","127":"Wow. Didnt think I'd like this as much as I do! You never think \"The Fonz\" when watching this version of the classic story.  Three quarters through this movie I hated Winklers character!! What a creep!\nExcellent movie IMO.","128":"I didn't like it when it first came out. But I guess it grows on you.","129":"No offense to the performers, because they were good. This just works best with the setting in England.","130":"good movie!","131":"Did not like at all","132":"This movie was not what I expected, however, it's worth a look (if it's free on Prime). It just wasn't for me man.","133":"It was difference and good.","134":"There's only one version of A Christmas Carol that I don't like and I won't mention it here. As someone who collects movies of A Christmas Carol, and reads the book almost every year, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the portrayal of Scrooge by Henry Winkler. Set in the depression, this American version works very well for the story.","135":"I saw this movie decades ago and tracked it down because it tells the entire story of Ebeneezer Scrooge. Felt sorry for him throughout and celebrated hi salvation at the end.","136":"I watched this on Amazon Prime and immediately bought a copy for my library.  A great modern retelling of Dicken's classic, with Winkler as the lead character--WELL acted.  Loved it!!!  The ending was extra nice; I wasn't expecting it.","137":"A great take on Dickens's classic with a twentieth century twist. It shows the range of Henry Winkler's acting ability.","138":"Great","139":"Loved it.","140":"The Fonz, who knew... this was a good take on the classic... not a waste of time... You probably know how the story is going to come out, but it is an enjoyable trip, none-the-less...","141":"I do not understand why this is not shown more than it is a Christmas time.\n\nIt is a semi-modern update on the Charles Dickens classic, A Christmas Carol.  Set in the during the depression the story line familiar and the characters refreshed.","142":"A version of Christmas Carol.  It's a good story based on the familiar theme with Henry Winkler as the Scrooge character. Some very talented actors were cast and the acting was very good.  If you like Christmas movies you should definitly give this one a try.","143":"A tad hooky but okay.","144":"It was merely okay.","145":"Thus is a clever way to tell the traditional story. We watch this every Christmas.","146":"I had remembered watching this when I was younger and enjoyed it. So I wanted to get and have to watch all the time. My husband and I did enjoy it.","147":"Terrible","148":"Henry Winkler is a better actor than he gets credit for.  He makes a credible American version of Scrooge.","149":"Favorite Christmas movie","150":"great for christmas movie","151":"Good movie and came on time. Thanks.","152":"Terrific Christmas movie. A new twist to A Christmas Carol","153":"Great movie","154":"Love it!","155":"My sweetie and I swap movies.  Her folks slept through the 80's and mine hated classic movies. She really loved this one of mine and it was even better than I remembered. Clarity was superb and Henry Winkler's interview was great!","156":"4 Stars","157":"Great remake!  I would like to add this to my own collection of movies.","159":"From all the Christmas Carol's I watched based on dickens book I liked this the best.  As a boy I watched this on TV and this was not long after Henry Winkler ended his career as the Fonz.  Personally i think he should have made a bigger career as an actor but i assume he may have been type casted and thus shortened his acting future.","160":"Great version of A Christmas Carol - we love it. The seller was fantastic - shipping faster than indicated and the price was amazing! Another great addition to our Christmas movie collection.","161":"I'm only docking this version of the Dickens classic one star because Henry Winkler will always be \"the Fonz\" to me, and I still hear the voice of \"the Fonz\" when Winkler delivers his lines as Mr. Slade, an American version of Scrooge from the Herbert Hoover era.  He plays young and old versions of the character, and sounds, to me, especially out of character as the old\/new Mr. Slade.","162":"loved it.","163":"I love this adaptation of the classic tale.  Henry Winkler is, of course, one of my favorite actors.  This is a different slant from the original but it gets the message across none the less.  Well worth the viewing.","164":"I always liked Henry Winkler and he did not disappoint. He played a good mean man.... stayed with the original plot for the most part..","165":"It started out promising, but it began to drag on and on focusing on too much irrelevant history.","166":"This is a great movie. It's a twist on a classic of scrooge.","167":"An unusual take on \" A Christmas Carol.\"  This movie takes place in New Hampshire in the early 20TH century. It is a made for tv movie on a very low budget.  It has some good parts and the acting is not bad, but Henry Winklers' make up is very badly done, when he made this movie he was in his late 40's and he plays an old Scoroge, in this case Slade.in his 80's. Interesting but I would not recommend it.","168":"Nice twist to a great classic story","169":"I have seen this several times and enjoyed it more each time. Highly recommended!","170":"Different than the original but still good","171":"Cute, but not as good as original.","172":"This is a really good take on the original A Christmas Carol. I liked this version and Henry Winkler does a fine job!!!","173":"Great twist on original","174":"This is a great alternative to A Christmas Carol\/Scrooge.  It is a twist on the original, but still a very enjoyable Christmas movie.  Henry Winkler is great as the lead character.  He plays an elderly miser very well.","175":"As advertised. Very nice. An easy and problem free transaction. Thank you.","176":"Great Christmas story","177":"Great DVD","178":"NICE TWIST TO THE ORIGINAL","179":"Henry Winkler is a bad actor and has never had much talent.","180":"gift. Loved it!","181":"Nice","182":"This is a different spin on the classic \"The Christmas Carol\".  It is nice, and you might want to add it to you Christmas collection.","183":"Love anything to do with a Christmas carol. Henry Winkler is excellent great telling hard to find excellent condition. Really enjoy it!  A little different telling but same result.","184":"Great classic XMas movie","185":"Oldie, but a goodie","186":"Great movie","187":"GOOD, BUT NOT THE ALL TIME CLASSIC","189":"A very good American rendition of the Christmas Carol story.  The entire cast presents a great family movie to view during the holiday season.  This is a keeper!","190":"Well-cast, wonderfully told version of \"A Christmas Carol\".  I watch this at least 10 times each Christmas season.","191":"I enjoyed this movie very much.","192":"BORING !!","193":"This item was exactly what I was hoping for. However, there was one glitch in the recording.","194":"Good working order","195":"Great movie","196":"watched it for Christmas thought it was excellent glad I bought it.","197":"Excellent","198":"i like it a lot","199":"I love just about any movie that has to do with The Christmas Carol. I can now add this one to the list.","200":"Good movie but not my favorite.","201":"I love this version of the christmas carol...","202":"Great","203":"an excellent christmas movie. quite a delight.","204":"Terrible version of this movie, poor acting! And I love Henry winkler ! I donated this movie","205":"An updated superior version of a classic which has to be THE most underrated christmas classic.  Winkler, as another reviewer posted, really demonstrates his incredible acting ability.","206":"Great American Version of Charles Dickens \"A Christmas Carol\". Excellent ensemble acting!  A must to watch every holiday season!","207":"great version of the traditional story!","208":"This is a very good movie. Henry Winker is excellent.  It is touching and will warm your heart for Christmas.","209":"Classic","210":"A must to own for you Christmas collection.  Henry Winkler is amazing in this uptake of Scrooge.","211":"A great acting job of Henry Winker. Good take on The Christmas Carol with an American view.","212":"well well well, lots of talent here","213":"A great remake of Charles Dickens' - \"A Christmas Carol\"! Additional Fact: I wish the lines of.the novie were sub-titled!\n63x927is58401","214":"One of the better remakes of A Christmas Carol, plus Henry Winkler does the part justice.  He is very believable in this roll.","215":"Amazing. Gives a whole new view.","216":"i am very happy with this dvd","217":"good copy","218":"great story","219":"Great","220":"I remember watching this as a kid on prime time television.  I love this unique version of a Christmas Carol.","221":"Best performance ever","222":"I have always loved this version of A Christmas Carol, but the quality was always poor.  If you can get this on blu-ray, I recommend that.  This is a great movie, though.","223":"I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.","224":"Henry Winkler is a fine actor and this version of the famous story is proof positive. He does and excellent job as Ebeneezer Scrooge. The story, of course, is the same as the other versions, but each remake brings a different interpretation by the actors and writers. This one is fun and easy to watch. A fine family film.","225":"This was one of my favorite holiday movies as a kid.  Although it is tailored after Charles Dickens Christmas Carol, this movie has some distinct differences which actually make it stand on its own merit.  I love the regular story of Christmas Carol, but this is refreshingly different and a must see.","226":"An American Christmas Carol...based on the classic by Charles Dickens, \"A Christmas Carol.\" Now that I've written something, you need to cut down the word number requirement. That's really stupid.","227":"Henry Winkler plays a great part in this movie, brings it to life! Good modern version of Scrooge! Don't miss this classic","228":"This is my favorite Christmas Carol movie. I have waited for it to come out, and when I finally looked it up again, I bought it!","229":"It is pretty much the traditional Scrooge story, but set in America in about 1880.  It does give a twist to it to help Americans tie the story into a scene in their history.","231":"I thought his was a great twist on A Christmas Carol that put it in a more relevant perspective for these times","232":"Another entry in the retelling of the classic.  Ho hum from start to finish.  Henry Winkler is not believable as a Scrooge type.","234":"It has been years since I first saw this version of a Christmas Carol. I had remarked to my daughter that I would like to see the Christmas Carol version with Henry Winkler one day when we were discussing all the different versions. I was glad I was able to watch and enjoy it again.","235":"Winkler does a little over-the-top in his role as the scrooge character and the production values leave somewhat more to be desired but all-in-all a nice rendition for holiday viewing.","236":"I liked Mr Winklers pertrayal of a depression error Ebineser. He played the part of promising, driven young man, to unmoraled business man, to kind hearted senior citizen quite well. It was not a big Holywood production. But for a made for TV Movie it was quite good.","237":"I love An American Christmas Carol with Henry Winkler.  In my opinion it is the very best version of Scrooge.  Hope everyone sees it and enjoys it as much as I do.","238":"Great American Versions of the Dickens's Classic.\nEnjoyed it very much This video is worth buying.\nIt has a modern view of a \"Christmas Carol\".","239":"An updated version of A Christmas Carol that doesn't lose any of the important stuff. Great movie for the family.","240":"Trying to make Dickens relevant again, this dresses him up in American hard times and values. Winkler is always a pleasure to watch. I don't know, however, how Winkler would have Dickens speak if set in post-2007 American, though.","241":"I thought the movie was great when it came out in 1979 and still think it's great today. This is a good movie for the whole family to watch; however, not sure if the kids of today would appreciate it.","242":"I got this for a person who has it on vhs and needed it replaced. They wanted to keep it in there collection. Thank you for the promptness of receiving it.","243":"It didn't grab our attention enough to finish it.  It was probably okay if it was the first Christmas movie you watched this season.","244":"Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of \"An American Christmas Carol.\"  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.  Ayyyyy!","245":"I collect all the (non-musical) versions of this story. This one is not seen often on TV. I watch it every Christmas. Good updated (1930's) version of the Dickens classic. TRY IT!! DVD has played well with no problems.","246":"It seems like just about everybody has made a Christmas Carol movie.  This one is the best by far!  It seems more realistic than all the others and the time period seems to be perfect.  The acting is also far better than any of the others I've seen; my opinion.","247":"I liked this production giving the possible American point of view.  We've all seen the original Christmas Carol but I'd highly recommend this to anyone.  We watched this with our grandchildren whose interest was kept the entire length.","248":"This was an interesting take on the old \"Christmas Carol\" movies inspired by Dickens novel.  My husband loved it.  It is about people in the  depression era and it was interesting to see the scenery, clothes and furniture, etc.  The acting was very good, too.","249":"Ignore some of the more negative reviews on here. This made for TV movie really touches me every time I watch it; which is every Christmas.\n\nThe acting is splendid and the story is well written. It is suitable for the entire family and it gives a good picture of the depression era of our country.","250":"This was a movie from my youth that I would watch every year. I just love it. I am a Charles Dicken fan.","251":"This is hardly ever on TV and thankfully found on Prime. This movie captures the 30's as well as Dickens' Christmas Carol","252":"All I can say is watch it and judge for yourselves.  I used to live in Concord, and it is not truly historically accurate. though there does appear to be a genuine Concord Coach in Slade's barn and there is indeed still a granite  quarry.","253":"This is one of the best Scrooge movies out.  Henry Winkler outdoes himself.  The casting is excellent and the music and theme old but very relevant.","255":"It was pretty good. It takes the classic Christmas carol set originally in London and brings it to America.  Henry Winkler does a good Scrooge character","256":"The small historic Canadian town of Elora, with its many century-old buildings, is the perfect setting for this story, set in the early 1900's.  Bringing the story to 20th century America allows the story to incorporate situations Americans can more easily with.  Henry Winkler does a great job of recreating the Scrooge character, and the supporting cast are no less admirable.  This is an annual \"must watch\" story for me.","257":"Set in the USA about the time of the depression it is an update of that old familiar story of redemption.  The story is classic and this one is as good as all the rest.  Henry Winkler is good in this role.","258":"This is one of my fav versions....set during the Depression in America. It's unique regarding Scrooge's upbringing in an orphanage (when he repossess the orphanage's piano on  Christmas Eve!)","259":"Very well done, Henry Winkler is a smooth guy. Close to the original story line, so is fun to watch from an American perspective.","260":"Good remake of Christmas Carol with relatively few twists.  Set during the great depression in the U.S. Henry Winkler is generally good, but gives a few too many Fonzi looks for me.","261":"I saw this for the first time in the 80s and liked the \"American\" twist on the Charles Dickens' classic. I love this story in all versions, as the first version for me was Mr. Magoo!!","262":"This is Charles Dickens' classic Christmas Carol with an American twist.  This version does a nice job of capturing the consequences of history and one's personal role in it.  It provides a sobering view of the main character's choices, just as the original, \"A Christmas Carol,\" did but this version also shows how one man's choices affect those around him.  I recommend this film to anyone who collects different versions of, \"A Christmas Carol.\"","263":"A good Christmas carol dhenry winkler one during the depression. Henry winkler does a good job.a classic film I recommend for all ages.","264":"I have searched for this film for years and finally found it here on Amazon. Saw it on television years ago and it was one I knew I wanted.","265":"Henry Winkler is the one of the best Scrooge I've seen! We see a lot of Scrooge movies this was a breath of fresh air.","266":"A great acting job by Henry Winkler. I saw this many years ago and it'll always be a Christmas favorite.","267":"I'm a big fan of Christmas Carol-esk stories so I gave it an extra star for that. Of course, the storyline is cheesy and overworked in these types of movies but I actually enjoyed it. And Henry Winkler was excellent.","268":"Worth watching this new version of the classic.  It is a little slow in parts but still entertaining. The real negative issue and distraction throughout is Henry Winkler's make up that is supposed to make him look old.  It just looks like Henry Winkler with make-up that is supposed to make him look old.  Even if you did not know the actor you would know that it was makeup and not an old man.  The wig was very good though--looked very authentic.","269":"It was a nice twist on the classic. Henry Winkler is much better actor than most people think of him!","270":"This is a first for me, I didn't like this movie and I think I only had it on for about 20 minutes.  Acting just wasn't there.","271":"Just  OK, I had a a hard time putting \"Fonzie\" as a gruff person, and to me it was just OK, glad I watched it but not one of my favorites.","272":"This has been a favorite movie of mine for a long time.  Henry winkler is great as a modern day Scrooge.  There are many movies giving a new twist to Dickens, but this one is true to the original story.  It is set during the depression.","273":"I 'collect' movie versions of 'A Christmas Carol', This is a very good one. It is true to the spirit of the book while putting an American spin on it. If you really like Dicken's story you will probably enjoy this version.","274":"How a bitter old man comes to know the true meaning of Christmas. Realizing to late his lost love and life.","275":"I watched this when it came out on tv way back when, and I have looked for it ever since. I was so shocked when I saw it on here and I just had to have it. WATCH THIS, IT IS GREAT!!","276":"Every few Christmas seasons I watch this with my Mom.  The film makes us feel so good....it is well acted and never fails to leave a good feeling inside.","277":"this movie stars henry winkler. an enjoyable christmas tale. he was superb in this role. a twist on the old \"scrooge\".","278":"I almost began with \"what can I say\". Well, thinking about it I can say much about this Christmas tale. It is a great twist on a classic holiday movie. Henry Winkler is well know for his role as the \"Fonz\". He owned this movie through his portrayal of a miserable miser. His gradual aging from youth to old age was quite amazing. Oh Henry, you prove over and over what a quality actor can do for stage and screen.","279":"Among the best of this beloved Christmas story; We enjoy Henry Winkler's twist on Scrooge and the story-line. He makes for a very believable Scrooge, both pre and post \"redemption\"!","280":"I have always loved this rendition of A Christmas Carol with it's american twist.  I had it on VHS but finally gave up my player for a DVD player.\nPreviously only bootlegged copies were available.  I was very happy to find it recently produced on DVD\/Bluray.\nIt is a great Holiday movie.","281":"I had forgotten about this movie til I saw it on Amazon. Loved it when it came out and still do. The Fonz is really cool in this modern holiday classic.","282":"This is a timeless classic which shows that those people from the Depression era experienced a lot of what might have taken place in England during the time of Dickens.","283":"He did a great job as a Scrooge type character. I truly enjoyed this film. I liked him from the Happy Days show.","284":"This is one of my favorites... I was very happy to see it on this site. Henry Winkler  played this part well.","285":"We (my daughter and I) have collected just about every one of the DVD \"Christmas Carols\"... This was always a favorite of mine and We finally got a copy... It was great to watch it again..","286":"Henry Winkler does an excellent job as the stingy Mr Slade.  The counterpart to Ebeneezer Scrooge in this adaptation of the classic story.  It was wonderfully done.","287":"Henry Winkler is one of my favorite actors of all time.  He is wonderful in An American Christmas Carol!  This is another movie that has not been shown at Christmas in the last few years, but should be.  So glad that I could get it for my collection of favorite Christmas movies.","288":"I have always enjoyed this movie.  I had it on DVD but wanted it on Blue Ray and the quality is excellent.  I have no complaints and am very pleased to buy from Amazon.","290":"As we were picking Christmas movies this year, I remembered seeing one with Henry Winkler.  Took me a while to find it because I didn't recall the title correctly.  Told my wife she would really like it.  Was not disappointed.  A very good Christmas classic in my book.  Winkler is terrific in this role.","291":"A Family Classic and Henry Winkler makes it great. I would make a great gift for any of your family or friends.","292":"As usual, Henry Winkler gave a superb performance, (Way to go Fonzie). Owning quite a few movies and cartoons on the Christmas Carol, I must say that this version has a somewhat modern, 20th century, yet fitting theme. I loved it. Highly recommended!","293":"Although my husband prefers the original Christmas carol, he does like this as well.  I love it. Henry Winkler is very good in this movie. A nice change from the original Christmas carol movies.","294":"A wonderful story about the Christmas Spirit & how it changed the life of a very lonely, old miser.  A true witness that it is ''NEVER TOO LATE''  to open up you heart & life to others.","295":"Henry Winkler played a great part as Scrooge.  It gave yet another twist to all the Christmas Carols of the past.","298":"This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to","299":"The title says it all - this is a Christmas carol re-done. Henery Winkler play the part of Scrooge in this American version of the timeless Classic It is well worth the investment if you are a collector of the Christmas carol stories.","300":"My family really enjoys this more modern re-telling of Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" You have all of the basic elements set in depression-era America. Henry Winkler is fantastic as both the crotchety old Mr. Slade and the idealistic young Mr. Slade. It should really be part of your holiday movie collection.","301":"Glad that this american classic came out on dvd.  I have been waiting for it for a long time.  I haven't seen this production since it came out years ago.  Plus it's better than some Hallmark holiday movies.","302":"This is one of the best Christmas stories out there.\nIt was on T.V 15 or 20 years ago, I've been trying to track it down ever since.\nIt's the Christmas Carol - Scrooge story but with a new twist.\nIt takes place in America during the depression.\n\nReceived the product in excellent condition, in the expected time.\nAt a good price.","303":"Henry Winkler is excellent. The only thing I have to say is, there was too much time spent on his Christmas past. I got bored with it. Otherwise, it was good and worth the money.","304":"Not the best quality DVD, but it's a great story. I recommend it to all.","306":"The Christmas Carol is my all-time favorite movie, and I had ever version imagionable on VHS, including this adaptation, but the remarkably enhanced quality of the DVD version is extremely enjoyable to watch. This rendition gives it an American twist, as Henry Winkler did a wonderful performance of a modern-day Scrooge.","308":"This is an excellent remake of the Dickins' A Christmas Carol.  It should be placed along side your existing Christmas collection!","309":"Henry Winkler is very good in this twist on the classic story. Not a conventional remake, but a version of the story set in early America. Give it a try.","310":"A brilliant adaptation of Dickson's classic set in early 20th century New England.  Well written and well acted, Henry Winkler shines as a young entrepreneur who is more interested in wealth and progress than romance and family, until...  I don't want to give it away.  Trust me. You'll love it.","311":"Fun DVD and I always like the Christmas Carol, this is not quite up as high as others but I still watch it every year.","313":"My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Chrismas Carol.","316":"This is a wonderful movie. It stay faithful to A Christmas Carol, but it very American. A fun movie for one and all.","317":"One of the best \"Scrooge\" movies, a very creative adaptation.","318":"I am happy I got to see this and it plays on my UK DVD player.\n\nMr Slade is as nasty as all the other Scrooges and you can tell who the characters are, Slade is Mr Scrooge and Thatcher is meant to be Bob Cratchet.\n\nI am happy that I got to see this DVD because that is the only Christmas Carol DVD that I have not seen.","321":"My wife and I grew up in New Hampshire where this version takes place; so we can easily relate to the characters and setting.  Asside from this, we both really like this version because it places the story in a more comfortable setting in general; early America versus England.\n\nBoth spins are great, this just adds to an already powerful Christmas message.","323":"Henry Winkler stars in this remake of the classic tale of Scrooge.  This one is set in post-Depression era America and is oneof the best I've ever seen.  Winkler is equally at ease as a young man with a girlfriend or an old man with an attitude.  I watch this every Christmas and was delighted to discover it on DVD.  You'll love it!","325":"a must see","326":"very good","327":"Received intact and as expected","328":"I was satisfied.","329":"perfect","330":"Many changes \/ additions!","331":"Love it!!!","332":"Love these movies priceless","333":"WELL WRITTEN AND PORTRAYED EVERYONE SHOULD SEE IT","334":"Love Bible stories on disc.","335":"Great quality. Very good movie.","336":"The movie is well made and does the Bible story justice.  A true historical and inspiring story.","337":"I really liked this version of Joseph in the Bible Collection. I bought the one in Bible Stories and it was ok but the movie is more down to earth to the events and follows scripture better.","338":"Amazing movie that perfectly tells the Bible story of Joseph, the actors couldn't be more perfect, it tells the story exactly the way I pictured it!","339":"Good quality. Micheal","340":"Excellent format and an engaging adaptation of the life of Joseph. I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time and have played it for my own entertainment many times since then.","341":"very good movie , you will love it to .","342":"A good family movie, very enjoyable, and story was interesting and followed Bible Verses as close as modern day acting would allow.","343":"True to biblical narrative.","344":"good movie","345":"Very much","346":"it's okay","347":"If you gave this a high rating. It was for being a great HOLLYWOOD Production.. If you read the BIBLE you will find out Joseph was quite the opposite. It's in a small part a Christian movie. I can't see God pleased with exploiting sex scenes. If the Hollywood director when by the bible it would have raved reviews. It goes to show you how many BIBLE read the bible and how many never have opened one, going by all this Five star ratings.","348":"Very good movie","349":"Love this DVD.  I can't seem to get it back from people I've loaned it to as they love it too!","350":"Love this movie like to watch it and learn from it.","351":"Loved it.","352":"EXCELLENT!","353":"I first saw this movie on TBN.  I loved the movie and had been unable to find it anywhere.  Went looking on Amazon, and surprise. I found it.  I purchased it, and I have never looked back.  Very Good!","354":"All I can say it's great, especially if you own this Bible collection. Have a blessed year, God Bless","355":"Great","356":"This is a very favorite movie.  I truly enjoy watching this movie over and over and over again.","357":"Great movie","358":"This was a made for TV movie, that I watched when it was aired.  I love this story from the Bible.  It is so interesting and has such a good message for all of us.  This is the best production of this story that I've ever seen.  It is very thorough and emotional. A must see for everyone.","359":"I just watched this movie and follows the Torah very closely.  the acting and sets were really great to look at.","360":"The price tripled from two weeks ago. It is a good movie, good actors, and acting,  and pretty true to the bible story of Joseph and his brothers. But  it is not right that they increase the price so much. So I will wait until it goes back down to get another one.","361":"Excellent Movie!","362":"Like Joseph, many lives are lived from one tragedy to the next as learning, reshaping, the and the molding process of God takes place. But when it's time for these servants to come forth into the lives they have been trained for, they do shine with God's favor and glory on them, indeed!","363":"One of the best bible movies, that stayed close to the authenticity of the bible.","364":"Great Bible story I had to see agaig.","365":"EXCELLENT MOVIE","366":"Happy that it was the best version of this story...","367":"Very close to the story of Genesis.  If you ever wondered how the Israelites ended up in bondage, this gives you the history.","369":"Even tho it states bible collection it might as well have been sold in the back of a xxx video shop, the women wear see through clothes, and they might have worn these in period but they could have worn under ware under them, I would not recommend this video to anyone.....","370":"Love this movie and so does my husband. It never gets old!","371":"love it","372":"I have watched this film so many times that I cannot count.  Joseph provides a thoughtful look at a man of God who goes through betrayal, slavery, slander, imprisonment.  In the end, his faithfulness to God and his forgiving spirit are rewarded when I becomes the second most powerful man in ancient Egypt.","373":"Excellent","374":"I simply LOVE this story. Is so beautifully done. They must of spent a fortune with the sets and costumes. In my opinion even better than the settings used in Cleopatra (with Elizabeth Taylor) Very good acting as well. Worth buying and the message is tremendous.","375":"Really good movie","376":"First watched this as a teenager in youth group at church.  Was happy to find the 2-cassette VHS version a few years ago.  Am now happy to have it on DVD for continued enjoyment.\n\nThis tells the story of the Biblical character Joseph, from his days as a young shepherd, to being sold by his brothers into slavery in Egypt, to becoming the second-most-powerful man in Egypt and an eventual reunion with his family.  It's a well done production that brings the story to life.","377":"One of my favorite biblical stories ever. I love this movie. The quality of the package was beyond safe and arrived right on time","378":"great movie","379":"A Beautifully written and produced film. And a story that is true today.","380":"New movie at a great price. Excellent time and condition.","381":"Just something more uplifting to add to my video collection","382":"Enjoyed the movie. Closely follows scripture and great for families to view.","383":"The story of Joseph was my grandfathers favorite story and his grandchildren heard him recount the details weekly. This \"Joseph\" DVD is quite long, 3+ hours but worth every minute. My favorite by far of this series on Old Testament characters. You will not be disappointed.","384":"Fine performances. Good quality dvd.","385":"This movie is so totally, wonderfully, Biblically accurate!  It puts the emotion into the story of Joseph and allows you to literally FEEL what he must have experienced.  Wonderfully done and so very moving.","386":"Great movie!!!","387":"no comment","388":"Stunning. Obviously you should read the Bible first and after, to know what happened and compare, but this is close enough and done very well. Love the music!!!!","389":"all good ty","390":"Very good Ben Kingsley plays the part of the pharoh excelently. Congrats to keeping wth the biblical content,to many tend to drift apart Biblical, to Holywood.","391":"It was very close to the bible , loved it","392":"Loved this movie for entertainment and for history's sake","393":"Good Video","394":"satisfied","395":"Watched at least a dozen times and never lacked a good version of the bible story line of the true Joseph and his love for God.","397":"Great","398":"i love this movie exellent service","399":"Excellent minus the bath scene.","400":"Very good movie! I really enjoyed this about the life Joseph! Ben Kingsley was outstanding!","401":"A wonderful story that is just very well done. Good acting, Ben Kingsley and the cast are just perfect in each of their roles. Beautiful footage of what the Holy Land must have looked like, no matter Where it was taken. The richness of the period costumes, customs, attitudes and the connection of the people to the land itself and to kin. All the details appeared to be nicely taken care of","402":"good movie","403":"great movie","404":"GREAT","405":"Good Movie","406":"This movie inspired a person who had no clue who Joseph was. Thank God for spiritual movies  Like these.","407":"they need to stay with the word of god...quit adding their own stuff to sell the movie...he never kissed potiphar's wife in the bible...he would not sin against god.....other parts were okay....seen better versions of it.....","408":"whats not to love, Ben Kingsley!!!!!!","409":"MY Favorite bible story.","410":"Thanks for everything.","412":"Thank You","413":"Great Movie.","414":"Good biblical interpretation and good acting!! Loved it! The story of Joseph is one of my favorite stories in the Bible.","415":"I like this move.

I love this particular movie.","432":"Awesome!!!!","433":"Inspirational and uplifting.","434":"Good re-enactment of Bible history. This is not a cheesy movie. Good acting by well-known performers. Maybe not 2015 technology but still excellent cinematography, etc. Entertaining and educational.","435":"This series of biblical films are really quite good.  Not totally accurate to scripture but the presentations are good.","436":"Lots of fabrication, but we don't really know the whole story. It helps to envision beyond the written page.","437":"A true classic in every word.  This is a must for biblical video collections.  But with an all star cast how could you go wrong.  They did a great job staying true to the Word as well.","438":"pleased with purchase","439":"awesome","440":"Outstanding film!","441":"Great bible story worth watching and learning the story\/events.","443":"This is amazing, a true count from the bible.  Joseph was perfect and Ben Kingsley as  Potifar was great.","444":"Good","445":"enjoyed a lot","446":"This is an excellent production concerning Joseph who was sold into Egypt. The acting is excellent and the sets are as well. I bought 9 of these DVDs to give to my children and to add to our collection. I would completely recommend this DVD.","447":"no comment","449":"Great mini-series. Really like the story, characters and quality of the acting.","450":"The whole story of Joseph is not well known, but this video tells it well.  The suspense of the family dynamics are very intense.  It would be nice if families today could be so forgiving.","451":"Love this entire series. Joseph is very accurate to the Bible. Easy to watch and follow. Great way to teach the biblical section on Joseph, as it brings the words to life.","452":"Despite its long running time, this is one of my favorite movies.  The cast, the scenery, the acting and the story are all first rate.  The irony of the ending is delicious.  I have watched it many times and will watch it many more.  highly recommended.","453":"A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points","454":"This version I liked. Went behind the scenes. Not totally accurate but great version of this story.","455":"I read the Bible quite often and teach Bible classes from time to time. This is a very accurate account of the \"Joseph\" story.","456":"This film is one of the better films made about stories of the Bible.  Very little poetic license was taken with it - they stuck to the scripture very closely and Sir Ben Kingsley is brilliant at Potipher.","457":"I must admit this bibical movie has it all. Passion,Suspense and Temptation. I think this is more for a mature audience. Due to some scenes in this film I wouldnt advise children to view it. But the cast and movie is wonderful. It's truly a movie worth watching!","458":"This is one of my most favorite stories in the Bible, recommend this one to anyone who loves a good Bible story.","459":"I own a lot of Bible stories from this series on CD. This one is particularly good. You can't beat the Holy Bible for great story lines!","460":"This one was really interesting!  Loved it completely.  Acting was exceptional.  It flowed so well.  I liked the temple of it.  Everything fell into place.  No fillers to eat up time.  This Movie is a Winner!","462":"No matter how many times I watch it, it is still very moving. Excellent acting, excellent adherence to the true story, and something I will soon not forget and enjoy watching again. I bought several copies to give as gifts.","463":"I cannot help but notice that ALL of those who serve God have to suffer for him. Though the churches today teach you don't have to suffer, the Bible says different. I wish I were as strong as Joseph. He sure isn't a \"why me\" type.","464":"This item goes with the rest of my bible collection. It is a must have and it is close to the bible, and again you do have Hollywood theatrics","465":"You will enjoy the story of Joseph , it's very entertaining , it will keep you watching, what's going to happen to Joseph next . The good think about the story of Joseph is where he ends up at the end . Good story excellent film.","466":"I'm always on the look out for quality films but especially for the holidays. I had seen this movie many years ago on television. I believe they made it into a mini series. The acting was wonderful. The story line uplifting. Great example of faith, hard work and being true to your beliefs no matter the circumstances and hardships.","467":"i am a big fan of this item was so glad to get it, and it was everything i hoped it would be","468":"This is my go to movie for when I need to be humble. This telling of Joseph is very, very close to the Bible, and that is what I was looking for. Sometimes when you purchase this movies it is strictly Hollywood version. This time they got it right.","471":"Acting was very good, the story line was well done and included all the important parts of the tale  without adding too much conjecture in.","472":"Very well done.  Great acting for most of it.  towards the end the main character loses me a little bit, but for the most part I like it a lot.","474":"This is an excellent movie which I have used in Sunday School.  The youth were able to envision the Bible's narrative in Genesis much more clearly because of the fine acting and appreciative telling of the Joseph story.","475":"I love the story of Joseph and his brothers.  As the world might say, a tale of Joseph,  Nothing in the Bible is a tale or fabricated as the world might say.  Love the actor also love Ben Kingsley.","476":"Joseph clearly tells how God can use anyone.  Despite his background of brothers who hated him and sold him into slavery, he held on through prison years in Egypt and became the second highest, most powerful leader in Egypt.  When his brothers finally came to the realization that this leader under Pharoah was indeed their very own brother, it was then that Joseph forgave them for what transpired in his youth.  It's a lesson we can all take to heart.","477":"This was a great DVD. It tells the story of Joseph and his family. Good for the whole family and great for reinforcing your knowledge of the Bible.","478":"Great movie. Excellent acting and definitely not boring. Thank God like most Bible based movies these days this movie is exceeding with talent","479":"A believable re-telling of the story while respecting it. Exceptional performances by stellar cast. And all of it at a great price!","480":"to see how they take a name from bible (JOSEPH)  and turn it in to a dvd movie to show how it was in the bible days","482":"I thought the movie was sufficiently close to the Bible story. The sets were often lacking, but I enjoyed the movie anyway. I had a copy that I bought with the Bible Collection 7 or 8 years ago that I loaned out and never got back. I was happy to get this at around $7.\nI recommend the Bible Collection highly.","483":"This is a fantastic movie or the retelling of the Story of Joseph.  The scenery in the movie is fantastic too.  The actors are great in each of their roles.  I'm glad I ordered this movie.  Saw it many years ago.","484":"I have watched this movie several times.  I really enjoy it.  It is an accurate account from the Bible.\n  Thanks candpfoote","485":"Just what I ordered. No surprises. I am a pastor and we just  finished studying the book of Genesis and w finished that book by watching this movie.","486":"This is my favorite movie of all times. It is so realistic that I cry every time I watch. The characters are extremely good in their acting, and I especially enjoyed the Joseph character, Paul Mercurio. I would definatly  recommend this movie!!","487":"I liked this movie, except one scene where Potipher's wife is seducing Joseph, and he has a hard time resisting at first, whereas, Biblically, I think he was stronger than that.  I REALLY like the actor playing Potipher.  Because of the scene mentioned, I am hesitant to allow my younger children to view it. But, other than that, it was done excellently.","489":"gave it as a gift to my sister she love it.  a good telling of the life of Joseph, son of jacob.","490":"I used this movie in my prison ministry bible study. It was very well done and followed the bible very closely. Joseph as revealed in the book of Genesis of the scripture is a type of Jesus and the movie brought this out which shows an obvious insight and knowledge do God's word. I would highly recommend this DVD for all family viewing.","491":"I had these three DVD, this one Joseph and David and Abraham for a long time. I believe it was in the late 1990,s and I got them on VHS and then I donated them to a nursing home because I knew they would really enjoy them. And then I  brought them on DVD. So I have enjoyed this movies for a long time. I also got Abraham on VHS and I gave it away and brought it on DVD. All were excellent.","492":"This movie is very inspirational to me, it helped me through my trails and tribulations during the time I needed it most, this movie relates to me.","493":"This portrayal of Joseph's story is very good.  It is biblically pretty accurate and features good performances by the actors.  I recommend it to individual and family audiences!  It's one of the great stories of the Bible.","496":"I recommend this movie, Joseph. It is a great reprentation of  of a truly kind, just, and merciful God and the people He loves. We all need positive and true to life movies that are not only good for the heart, but for the soul.","497":"Ah, my favorite Bible story. After watching this and seeing how well produced it was, I can only say that I watch it ast lease twice a month.","498":"This movie is very thoughtful and insightful in the portrayal of Joseph of Egypt. I would highly recommend this movie to all.","501":"This is a wonderful story of the beginning rise of the nation of Israel.  I would almost rate this movie as good as the Ten Commandments.  I found myself in tears at the end of this movie so new watchers beware!","502":"This movie is extremely well made. It is so touching when Joseph's brothers throw him into a pit. His crying and pleading with them to be merciful is so moving as is the part when Joseph finally meets his brothers again and tells them who he really is.\nExceptionally well made, I recommend this movie as high as possible.  A true hero in a world of doubt and sorrows it helps to know that human issues of understanding, forgiveness and love are always with us and always have been.","503":"One of the better bible stories out there.","504":"The acting was good, the story was correct, but naked backsides was not necessary.  Also the Potiphers wife did not need to be so very seductive of a naked Joseph. Not a Christian movie.  I felt that even though it was probably portrayed truthfully, Christans do not need to see so explicit a scene.  This should be rated PG 13 at least.","505":"This film was expertly directed and brought out many good points of the history of Joseph. I would highly recommend this disk to anyone.","506":"Very good movie.  Another great Bible character truly comes to life and is a good message for the family.","507":"My son has been collecting the different books of the bible for a while now.  He is so excited that I am able to order these from Amazon.  He has a few more DVD'S that we need to order to complete his collection.  I'm am very pleased with the DVD and quick shipment.","508":"This telling of the story of Joseph in the TNT Bible Collection is very good.  Although certain liberties were taken with the account as fleshed out in the Bible, these did not impact the overall telling of the story in keeping with what the Bible reveals.  The use of Joseph telling of his early history with his brothers and how he came to be a slave in Egypt was done as a flashback, which actually enhanced the dramatic telling of the story.  Very nicely done and mostly true to the Bible account.","510":"Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lowely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.","511":"I really loved this movie ,it describes the biblical account pretty accurate. it starts w\/ Joseph being sold to Egypt and backtracks after Joseph is accused from Potiphars wife, when Joseph defends himself in front of Potiphar through telling him his life story. I was clued to the screen the whole time. Also the actor for Joseph is very likable and also Jacob(Martin Landau) did a great performance.","512":"This is an incredible telling of the story of Joseph and the roller coaster ride on which he rode.  One of many Biblical Old Testament stories made by Turner Films and this is of very high quality.  Not the wooden-like acting which is not uncommon in Biblical story telling in some past films.  This is first-class and definitely worth 5 stars.","514":"This movie kept as true to the actual bible as any movie I have ever seen. A good example of how God's miracles sometimes take a whole life time.","516":"I'm very glad to have found this movie on dvd. I have seen it in stores; but it was more affordable through Amazon. I look forward to viewing the movie \"Joseph\" , perhaps with some friends, becauce I am currently studying the life of Joseph. I recommend the film to anyone who has yet to see it. Many thanks. SHAWN","519":"As described and fast shipping.","520":"As described and fast shipping.","521":"Magnificent acting, writing, directing, set design--the story is extremely compelling and the ending uplifting. It teaches many principles of virtue without in the least being preachy. There is much conflict, suspense, surprise, and believable twists in this absorbing drama. I watched it many times and learned many useful lessons from it. Buy it and enjoy it.","522":"This is the best and most accurate rendition of Joseph's life.  This is great for the family.","528":"This was one of the best movie from a Old Testament Biblical story.  The only problem with this is the nude scene when \"Joseph\" was nude in the water.  I think  this could have been left out and the story would had been perfect.","529":"I LOVED this movie. It was very well made and held my interest from beginning to end.","530":"A truly wonderfully made film, mostly accurate to scripture and brilliantly acted. Joseph's brothers are the stars here in their own right but Paul Mecurio is in fine form as well.","533":"Joseph is my favorite movie out of the Bible Collection. I am going to get one movie at a time as I can afford it until I have the whole collection.","534":"Although I had enjoyed the Bible movies that were broadcast by Turner on TNT, \"Joseph\" turned out to be a cut above the rest in regard to the scope of the production, the writing, and the performances of the actors. It really seemed to capture the essence of the story in the book of Genesis.","535":"Joseph is the ideal role model for EVERY Christian\/Jew. He is an example of what we should strive for. Waiting for a spouse to have sex. Sticking to your God no matter the outcome. This movie reflects all of that perfectly. The actors did a great job. When I first saw this years ago I was blown away by the quality!! That was back in the VHS days...cant wait to see it on DVD. So I cant speak for the transfer quality yet, sorry.","544":"Classic","545":"Perfect for my 6 month old grandchild.  HE LOVES IT.","546":"Super good DVD for little ones!","547":"Songs are good but need a bit more diversity.  I would like my kids to see other kids that look like them in more than just a random passing image.","548":"Loved it.","549":"Not really action songs.","550":"Received product ordered as advertised.","551":"Very good.","552":"Great songs","553":"This is not a sing along dvd and it was difficult to understand some of the words being sung. I would not recommend it.","554":"yes we are very happy with are Action Bible Songs, thank you, my Grand daughters love all three DVD's thank-you Cedarmont Kids","557":"This movie is so great! This film shows a different side of Jesus, a wonderful side. It was a whole lot better than the other \"Jesus\" films....","558":"YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN, GET BAPTIZED AND HAVE HOLY SPIRIT ABIDING IN YUR HEART.","559":"touching; A++++++++","560":"Met all expectations and more!","561":":)","562":"Nice to buy good and cheap movies.","563":"Jesus follows the Bible quite close I should say the Book Of Luke.","564":"Classic, true-to-the Bible.  It's been translated into many languages and has caused many to believe that God truly did die for our sins in a human body on a cross, then rose up from the dead.\n\nWhat I especially like is the crowds' reactions to his teachings.  He was a bit of a \"stand-up,\" seasoning his picturesque messages with humor!\n\nBravo!  Well-done!  Encore!","565":"thank you","566":"This is an excellent, Biblically accurate video.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I don't know how long I'll be hanging on to this one, because passing it along is what it was made for -- but I'll enjoy it while I have it!","567":"HERMOSA HISTORIA DE JESUS !!","568":"we saw very good movie thank alot","569":"they did a very good job taking the book of Luke, studying it.  and doing tons of research how the lived in the time of Jesus.  A very good cast for the movie.","570":"Recoomen","572":"This film is a classic true story about the Son of God taken entirely from the Gospel of Luke. I also recommend a video called the Gospel of John, get the 3 hour version it is totally worth it! The Gospel of John is a 5 star film.","574":"This is a pretty good version of the story. I have not heard of it before although it is advertised to be well known.","576":"It was a moving movie about Jesus. We had this picture on VHS and it had a wrinkle in the tape, so this is a replacement tape.","577":"One of the best Christian movies out there. Portrays the gospel of Luke very accurately. Nothing but Jesus and the gospel. The script comes straight out of the Bible.","578":"I found this movie on YouTube and wanted it to use in Sunday School.  I try to collect all of the movies about Jesus and this one was good.","579":"I bought this movie on advice that many Jewish traditions are shown in the depiction of Christ.  This movie is a faithful but not very high tech.  The miracles are usually explained or the viewer is expected to know what happened.  This is a good telling but not in the league of \"The Greatest Story Ever Told\".","580":"The Visual Bible Matthew word for word was excellent as compared, but this complete message is great too.  This film invites a decision concerning Christ.","581":"I did enjoy the movie. It seemed to follow scripture very well. I shared the movie with my parents as I had it already under a different jacket. I am sure anyone will like the movie and it is good for all family members.","583":"Nice teaching tool. The message is clear even though production values are low. It looks and sounds like an episode of Little House on the Prairie. Definitely not a major motion picture or epic. But it does well at telling the story of Jesus: the son of man who was born to be the son of God, nothing more and nothing less.","584":"I had heard about 'The Jesus Film' for a long time, but for some reason, I had not watched it until now.  I am very glad that I saw it.\n\nThis is a superb depiction of the life, words, and deeds of Jesus Christ.  Taken from the book of Luke, it is a beautiful and highly accurate portrait of the most important person in the history of the world, the Savior of the World - Jesus of Nazareth.\n\nThis is not one to rent.  This is one that is well worth buying, sharing with others, and watching again.","585":"We bought the dvd to replace a vhs that had wore out.  An extremely well done movie on the life of Jesus Christ.  All the words are taken from the book of Luke, a new testament book of the Bible.  We watch it several times a year, especially around Easter and Christmas.  My fifteen year old said it is still as moving as the first time she watched it.","587":"This was told from the Gospel of Luke. It is a nice story, Slightly dated. If I saw this used for a few dollars, I might pick it up.","588":"Beautiful story about Jesus Christ, the best I've watched. All of the actors look so natural, the music is superb and the text is so clear. Very interesting documentary about Jesus' public life but this is a film of about only 1,5 hours. I remember that the whole TV series was about 8 hours. It would be much better to have the whole series in a box set.","590":"Please tell 'em that Amazon is going to lose me as a reviewer if they make it complicated!  Five stars means that I got the order promptly and in good condition!  I don't know how to communicate with them.","592":"Of course, the story of Christ is as ageless as God Himself.  This film was so well put together and released back in 1979, that it needs no update.  The movie was filmed mostly on-location for authenticity.\n\nThis DVD fits appropriately in any Christian's collection, and serves well in ministry projects as well.","593":"This is a good movie to share with your friends and family.  My favorite is still the Gospel of John.  With that said, this is still a good movie to get.","594":"Awesome movie about our LORD JESUS CHRIST.\n\nI also recommend, The Gospel of John, this too is an awesome movie, a must for your Christian movie collection.\n\nI thank the Almighty GOD for JESUS in our life's.","596":"I they were selling this movie at my church when a special guest came one Sunday. I bought this movie and I have to agree that this is the best movie I have ever seen on the life, death and resurrection of my Lord Jesus Christ. I haven't seen \"the Passion\" yet, I plan to very soon and I have high hopes for the film, but this one is equally as good.\n\nVery well done film that was done with great care, excellent movie I recommmend everyone see","598":"All I wanted was a dvd of this movie the way I saw it on cable tv. But NOOOOOOOOO! They had to ruin the movie by tagging a 5 minute preachy ask Jesus into your life message. And omitted some written scripture that scrolled the screen at the end of the film with an astronomy back drop.","604":"This Jesus film is true to the Gospel of Luke.  That is good and bad.  It sticks very close to the Gospel of Luke and avoids the Hollywood straying which most Jesus films undertake.  However, because it is so closely tied to Luke, there is no crown of thorns on the head of Jesus (which is not mentioned in Luke).  Because I am a stickler for accuracy, I think this is the best Jesus film available, even without the crown of thorns.","608":"This is so lame! The songs are terrible! The villan is a ripoff of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons while the kids look like they're on loan from a Charlie Brown show. But the biggest lowpoint is the Politically Correct ranting! Too bad CBS insists on running this back-to-back with the 1969 classic.","611":"My daughter liked the Santa Claus movie she now knows who Chris Kringle is according to the movie.","612":"An oldie but goodie.  This is one of the Christmas classics that I have to watch every year and it's nice to own it so I can watch it when I want to instead of having to depend on national television channel.","613":"Very entertaining. Classic. No chips cracks or scratches.","614":"very good","615":"I bought this to watch with family near christmas. I love the animation, characters, and story.  Gotta love the christmas classic animations and now I have it for good.","616":"This was a show that was on TV so many years ago. It is a show that needs to be shown every year. times were much simpler then.","617":"Excellent item","618":"AWESOME Family show.  Been watching this forever!!!","619":"This is my favorite since I was a kid. Burger Miester Miester Burger .","620":"great classic","621":"Great price and good quality DVD. Enjoyed watching this movie, another favorite for the Holiday list.","623":"Real cute movie.","624":"This is a classic.  Had to have it for Christmas and all year.","625":"It was delivered in great condition. Oh yes I will order again from this company. Thank you for the opportunity to buy this child good DVD movie for me. Now I can watch it anytime I wish. God Bless... ","626":"great buy","627":"I would live here if I could sing","628":"Gotta love the classics.","629":"Great movie!","630":"An old favorite brought to life again.  My grown children and I loved it.","631":"good condition","632":"A family favorite.","634":"Great classic Christmas movie that I watch every year.","635":"Fun nostalgia!","636":"Love this holiday classic and it is watched many times throughout the holiday season.","637":"Love this movie","638":"Classic","639":"Purchased for my father for Christmas.  I was very happy to find this in Blu-ray.  This is one of his (and my) favorite Christmas movies!","640":"MY GRANDDAUGHTER LOVES THIS CHRISTMAS MOVIES, NOW SHE CAN WATCH THEM ALL IN THE SAME DAY","641":"Reminds me of my childhood.","642":"Again I say, all Rankin-Bass shows are the best(IMHO) to watch at Christmas Time....\n.....and Merry Christmas to everyone who reads this.","643":"This is one of my favorite Christmas stories. I enjoy watching it every year.","644":"A Christmas movie classic. I watched this with my 3 year old niece and she loved it!","645":"Love this classic holiday movie. Grew up watching it every holidays season and now I look forward to my children enjoying it.","646":"A Christmas classic.","647":"Wish more of these classics would be offered on Prime.","648":"Love this movie","649":"I really enjoyed watching this movie because it was so entertaining and it also put in the mind of Christmas.","650":"I watch this every year","651":"love the winter warlock, awesome show!!","652":"It's the classic without commercials or cuts to add more commercials.  Jessica even gets her big psychedelic solo.","653":"Not At This Time\n\nThank You .","654":"Excellent children's fare. Unfortunately, they don't make them like this, anymore. Too much emphasis on glitz and special effects, in today's youngsters' videos.","655":"Arrived in time will enjoy for Chritmasseller did good","656":"Reliving childhood","657":"love this movie","658":"Everything was great...","659":"Perfect condition. Exactly as pictured and described. Very pleased with purchase.","661":"good cartoon  about christmas","662":"a must have classic!","663":"Rating is for:  Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town, the original TV special from Rankin and Bass.  It is the Best!  I love it.  However, if you like the other similar shows, then BUY it in a combo pack to save a lot of money!  Do not buy just one at a time!","664":"Fun dvd","665":"I love these old Christmas puppet movies! I will definitely have my kids watching these!","666":"A classic. Absolutely love it","667":"santa'd out","668":"Great","670":"Our whole family loves all of these old Christmas movies.","671":"Wonderful movie I am grown and i love this movie kids will love this movie","672":"birthday present!!","673":"I love these movies! I highly recommend this for all family holiday DVD collection. Kids love them and even adults find themselves entertained with these!","674":"Have this in VHS & needed to upgrade to DVD","675":"great","676":"Love this classic movie","677":"Good for a VHS.","678":"loved it","679":"Love this movie at christmas time","680":"One of my favorite Christmas classics.  I love the scene where the future Mrs. Claus sings.  I will be watching several times this holiday season.  My nieces and nephews love it too.","681":"Childhood favorite.","682":"children loved it when they saw it. a classic","683":"It is a great movie. It was done by a stop motion company in Japan and they did a great job. I love all the songs.","684":"dvd arrived on time and as advertised","685":"no review","686":"Fred Astaire and Mickey Rooney...what's not to like?  We bought this to replace the video tape.","687":"Christmas Classic to Own!","688":"Kids love this movie!","689":"This is a Christmas movie that has been lost through the years.  This Christmas movie is all about Kris Kringle as a child and how he became Santa Claus.  A wonderful family Christ movie that will bring a different dimension to Santa Claus no matter what your view is for Christmas.  I recommend this movie to all!","690":"When I was a kid  I always enjoyed these movies at time of christmas.....feels like time is back ....without black and white of course...","691":"I have this movie on VHS, but I have a DVD player now, and I enjoy sharing these old shows with my granddaughter. She is seven now and has to tell me to be quiet when I sing along! I never get tired of watching, this one is probably my favorite!","692":"I didn't watch this when I was young the way I did Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer and Frosty the Snowman except for maybe once but it is a good story and I did get it this year. Its a classic the way those other to and A Charlie Brown Christmas are and you should get it. Merry Christmas.","695":"I bought this for my 2-1\/2 year old granddaughter. She's just beginning to understand Santa, a little, so I thought this movie would help her and she loves movies. I bought this on VHS for my daughter when she was little and also bought her the DVD when it cam out. She's 25, I'm 57 and we both love this movie. Its a Christmas tradition.","697":"This is a DVD that every family should own. I don't care how old I get, this movie will always be my favorite especially since Fred Astaire is in it...lol.","698":"I watched this program as a kid and every year for the past few years have purchased it on DVD for my children to enjoy.  So glad to have a digital version.  My youngest sings songs from this episode all year long.","699":"I loved Topper so much I went out and sought a Topper blow mold to buy. This movie is adorable, and is definitely one of my holiday favorites. I watch it every year.","700":"This movie is one of a kind! This is what we watched back on the day and was happy to get it for our lil ones to watch on DVD.","701":"There are some things that take you back to your or your children's childhood. This is one of those stories. When my son was little, we would watch the Christmas specials together and this was one we both liked. The actors whose's voices you hear, some are no longer with us, but we can still enjoy their talent.","702":"We enjoyed watching even though we ordered late.  Will enjoy for years to come.  Great xmas story.  You\/your kids will love it.","703":"This has always been one of my Christmas favorites. And I have to admit I'm a fan of Fred Astaire. I always loved dancing and puppets. This TV movie will please young and old a like for the Christmas season. The Year without a Santa Claus should be part of your choices as well.","704":"It is always nice to enjoy a movie where I do not have to explain embarrasing actions or words. Fun for the whole family","706":"This movie is one of the great classic christmas movies. Really glad that I now have it on dvd, since I couldn't seem to find it on vhs when I was younger. Added to our ever growing chrismas collection.","707":"I like how it explains how all the Christmas traditions came together, but this was not the greatest Christmas special in my childhood. I never thought it was bad, I just did not like the idea of Burgermeister Meisterburger outlawing toys.because of my love for toys, I didn't quite like the idea of it, sort of my same issue with \"Toy Story.\" But it is still a good special.","708":"One of the few movies kids can watch without mom worrying about inappropriate scenes or information. Perfect for the holidays.","709":"I have such fond memories of this movie growing up.  It is the story of Kris Kringle...and is a classic!  A must have for Holiday DVDS!","710":"I wasn't so thrilled with this show as a kid and I guess I'm still not.  It lacks the excitement and warmth of some of the other Rankin Bass shows from the 60s.  It's Ok though.","711":"A Christmas classic right up there with Rudolph and Frosty the Snowman, this movie has been loved by children and adults alike since it first came out. For the $3 they are asking for it there's no reason not to buy a copy. This movie is one of the few that truely lets you know Christmas is here at last!","713":"I love all the rankin bass video's I own all the christmas one's, the monster party is kind of dull and the easter bunny one is good.","714":"THIS CLASSIC IS BEAUTIFUL ! I LOVED IT AS A KID , AND NOW I LOVE IT EVEN MORE !!!!!!!","715":"I could never remember what the title of this show was growing up although I always loved it.  Would have been more meaningful to call it the santa story or something.  All the questions of the santa story a answered here.","716":"Fast shipping, and Tape was in excellent condition.  Somehow these old shows are better in VHS.","717":"This movie is a MUST for children as it gives the \"history\" of Santa and the start of \"traditions\" for celebrating Christmas and Santa.  This gives the background of Old Man WInter, why reindeer fly and who Mrs. Clause was and is now.\n\n3 generations in this household LOVE this movie.","719":"Still my favorite after all these years, it's nice to have a special that can present the HO-HO-HO of the holidays and find a way to tie Santa in to the spiritual aspects of the Christmas season.  Wonderful animation, humor and songs-I am glad I finally got this one on DVD.","720":"This movie was my favorite as a kid and now, as an adult. I was watching again today and realized that the Burgermeister is really my sister. LOL Who knew?","725":"Just like I remembered it when I was a kid. My son (11) also enjoyed it alot! The figures are still a great way to do animation.","726":"This is a special, touching Christmas video.  Wonderful for the kids and to add to your Christmas collection","727":"The kids don't know who the characters are, but what the heck...they love it.  Maybe, just maybe some kid will want to see some other work of these guys.","737":"Excellent film for those that love classic Christmas stories. Buy it now. That's an order.","749":"Another great program in the drive thru history series that the whole family will enjoy. The kids love his silly costumes and he keeps them interested with wit and humor as they learn all about history. Great series !!","750":"Excellent, Dave makes going through the Holy Land so much fun. If you're going to Israel, you especially ought to watch these episodes before you go.","751":"Great series","752":"Informative humorous","753":"This is full with fun facts, true history of our bible, even a chuckle of laughter at the funny but sometimes corny host! This really is a great collection for the family.","754":"Get close and personal with the Holy Land !\nAnd crack up at a very informative yet sometimes wacky fella\nNice job !","755":"I so regret buying this movie. Why is it called Arthur's Perfect Christmas? The kids spend very little time on Christmas and more time trying to convince us that there are other religions just as worth while. Avoid at all costs!","756":"My nieces, sister and I love watching this movie every christmas to get us into the holiday spirit.  A really very great and fun movie that is enjoyable for the entire family.  I bought a dvd for my nieces as a Christmas present and also one for myself to add to my Christmas collection.","758":"A must for any children's Christmas movie collection. Arthur will always be a classic.","759":"great","760":"Cute children's movie","761":"Grandkids love Arthur. And Christmas. So this was  a natural to order.","762":"I have shown this film to my multicultural, international second grade classroom two years in a row.","763":"Arthur is a timeless show.  Great lessons for children to learn.","764":"We love Arthur! It's great that this film explores other seasonal holidays as well. A great learning experience that is entertaining for both kids and their parents.","765":"Absolute favorite Christmas movie - baby loves it!","766":"Good for children just learning to read.","767":"a very cute movie","768":"A wonderful Christmas DVD to have I your child's Christmas collection.  I have it in mine and don't even have kids.","769":"My kids love this episode! It's pretty cute.","770":"Very cute classic cartoon. My kids loved it.","771":"Wonderful Christmas story for the little ones!","772":"My family watches this every christmas, we had a vcr copy but the sound finally gave. THANK YOU AMAZON!! You saved christmas!","773":"Arthur is always a winner for my kids. Great video for little ones at Christmas!","774":"Love this","775":"Classic. I love the original Arthurs, and this one is just fantastic. We've watched it every single day since we got it, parent and child!","776":"Arthur reminds me of my childhood.","777":"I have been watching Arthur for 16 years. Started when my child was a toddler. I still watch it but this movie was not so great. The voices of the characters were not the same as the t.v. show and the songs were blah. I will continue watching the show but never this movie","778":"Loved this movie as a kid and still do, cute story. Very pleased with this purchase.","779":"I didn't watch it but my grandson enjoyed it","780":"Like","781":"Love watching this movie with my 6 year old daughter. We never get sick of it! I mean who could, it's Arthur! Love how it shows his friends culture and how they view christmas","782":"no comment","783":"Good buy","784":"The grandkids likes it","785":"great family christmas cartoon","786":"LOVE","787":"It was fun to watch, reminds me of my childhood everytime I watch arthur","788":"They speak rudely to each other.  Not something I want my children to learn.","789":"Present for daughter. Excellent condition. Thanks.","790":"Classic","791":"Good.","793":"This movie is suitable for kids of all ages!","794":"one of the shows we love to watch on pbs before bedtime every night","795":"Good","796":"My 7 year old granddaughter loved this. It's entertaining enough for adults to watch it with the kids. Lots of music and good humor.","797":"Love love love Arthur","798":"Kids 6&4 loved it.","799":"Our family watches this over & over.","801":"I have always loved this show and this is a wonderful Christmas special!","802":"I watched this with my 5yrs old daughter and she was very happy and noticed other holiday traditions!","803":"Wonderful Story!!!!! Grand Kids Loved it!!!!!!","804":"this is an adorable cartoon.","805":"no substance, waters down the true meaning of Christmas-Actually spends more time explaining the Jewish Holiday than the Christian Holiday.  And then there's a moment with a character and his mother where they don't really know why their celebrating Christmas and decide to make up their own Holiday.","806":"Cute! 6 & 7 year olds enjoy!","807":"Granddaughter watched it, but unlike other movies that she really likes, does not care to watch it again.","808":"ok","809":"Son loved it","810":"My children grew up watching Arthur and I purchased the VHS when the Christmas episode came out.  When we saw it on Amazon Prime we had to watch it.  It brings back a lot of fun memories of when the kids were little.","811":"When I think of a children's  Christmas special this is exactly what I wanted. Arthur is a familiar face to most kids and it focused on the spirit of Christmas and all the excitement leading up to the arrival of Santa. It's a must see for the holiday season.","812":"Pretty cute.  Good message.  Grandkids liked it.","813":"Great toon for toddlers... it is slow enough to have them understand something special is going on in this movie. The kids were quite till the end!","814":"Love Arthur great dvd perfect condition","815":"Not a fan and I thought I would like this.  The younger sister character was awful in this and I also wasn't impressed with the commercialism represented.  I wouldn't bother with this one and wish I hadn't.","816":"This is such a cute program, and had a very good message regarding different people's celebration of the Christmas holidays.","817":"I put this on to entertain my 3-1\/2 year old grand daughter.  She was completely engrossed in it from beginning to end!  Many children's movies will not hold her attention 'til the end, but this one did.  Of course she watched this in April so I plan to run it again for her when Christmas comes.","818":"Arthur was great when I was younger, and now it's just as good. It's a wonderful show with a great message.","819":"Grandchildren loved it and have watched it several times. They enjoy watching Arthur and I think there are good lessons in them.","820":"Grandson loved it, we watched it several times through the month of January. Will enjoy it again, I am sure.","821":"I love Christmas specials and try to watch all of them I can. This was great one for younger children or those of us who are young at heart!","822":"I have seen this show many times but it never fails to amuse. It is a great holiday show for the kids and adults and manages to educate as well.","823":"My seven year old grandson is really into SpongeBob, Sam and Cat, and Rabbit Invasion so I was shocked when this was the Christmas video he wanted to watch.  He thoroughly enjoyed it as did I.","824":"I bought this movie to go along with the book and it followed the book very well. The kids loved it.","825":"A more wonderful Christmas experience can't be had.  Arthur touches the heart as few ever do, and this is one of those shows that is enjoyable for children of all ages.  This is, I believe, the original Arthur cast, and this is voice-acted and drawn beautifully.  Arthur's Perfect Christmas is perfect Christmas family viewing...","826":"\" ARTHUR'S PERFECT CHRISTMAS\" is worth 5 stars for anyone young or old that loves the antics of the Read family. DW is just a character and what 5 year old isn't. And of course Arthuir as a BIG brother is no different than real life. What older sibling wants their younger sibling following them around, in their room, or just plain bugging them.. This DVD was great fun for Grandma and the Grand kids. Grandma watched it more than once!","827":"Arthur is one of those cartoon, that manages to be engaging while having the ability to wind children down instead of up. We love the opening song and the thoughtfulness of this delightful special that should become one of your holiday classics.","828":"My 3-1\/2-year-old granddaughter loves Arthur!  This is a typical Arthur movie and she enjoys them all!!!  Since Christmas is coming up soon, she particularly enjoyed this one.","830":"We have watched Arthur for years, so when I saw this on Amazon I knew I had to get it!","832":"My little one has always enjoyed watching Arthur. So when he came across Arthur's Perfect Christmas, he had to watch it. I really enjoy, that I am able to watch my Amazon Prime shows on my iPad.","833":"I've always liked the Arthur episodes on PBS and watched them with all the kids. So, to have a movie with Arthur and the gang was a pleasure! Christmas is a time for family, joy and sometimes a helping hand to makes things even better. This movie is one of those. Great for kids of all ages.","834":"This is such a nice Christmas video. The story line is good with several plots intertwining. One of our favorite picks for the season. It is appealing for both small children and older.","835":"Bought this for my daughter and she really likes it, she saw it prior to purchase so new it would be a hit","836":"I choose this rating because it's \"Authur\" a very wholesome cartoon for this generation of children.  The only reason as to why it did not receive 5 stars was because the voices are different...I'm not one for changing character voices although I realize Authur can't stay eight years old forever.  I just like the focus being in the everyday life of a little boy who's dealing with growing pains lol.  I would recommend it however don't depend on the episode to put you in the Christmas spirit alone... :)","837":"worth the $$ to purchase my little guy loves Arthur.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all !!","838":"This is one of the best children's videos to introduce other holidays and traditions in addition to Christmas. So glad I bought it.","840":"My kids are young (under the age of 4) and couldn't get into this. Plus I don't enjoy movies about Christmas when they're really about being politically correct.","841":"I have been watching this movie since i was a wee little lad and i still love it and watch it every christmas and whenever i feel like watching it cause it is soo good. it has good songs that are fun to sing along to and has some good lessons in it and even some good cooking lessons. it is informational about christmas and i just love this movie reccomend it to kids and grown up of all ages.","843":"My sister and I have watched Arthur since 1997 and we love it! I'm now  in college still watch the show when I have time.  Arthur's Perfect Christmas is a great movie to watch during the holidays. If you haven't seen it you should.","844":"This movie is perfect if you have young children. My daughters are 8 and 4 and they love Arthur.","847":"The DVD was blank, unfortunately.","848":"Definitely helped me with reducing my frequent urination when I utilize the exercises...even from day one!","849":"Really had high hopes after reading reviews for this; however, I have not seen an improvement after using for a few months. Giving 3 stars since things are not getting worse either. I do plan to continue to use this DVD since I am not seeing any worsening symptoms even though I remain very active and lift and carry my 3 year old who weighs 33 lbs.","850":"Very helpful, excellent  !","851":"Excellent","852":"Ok but not easy to follow , haven't noticed a big difference","854":"My mom bought this about 6 weeks ago and has shown significant improvement in bladder control.  She convince me to buy it and now I'm getting results myself.","855":"could have been more to it","857":"Liked the program.","858":"arrived on time, as advertised","859":"This is the best collection of pelvic floor exercises that I have ever seen. It takes just a few minutes a day and goes far beyond the simple kegel exercises. I would highly recommend it.","860":"very important exercises are presented here. not just kegel but other such as squats. i think in general these are great to do on a regular basis.","864":"If you leak urine it might help you - I did not have that problem though and I returned it.","865":"I love this DVD. The instructor is concise and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this to all women. It is the perfect DVD for our lower bodies. The exercises are challenging in a good way.","866":"Well, these exercises were helpful. I have found others that I like and are more portable if that means anything.","867":"This DVD is a GREAT resource! It offers women the opportunity to really DO something for their pelvic floor! As both a midwife and a woman with a pelvic floor injury, I highly recommend this DVD.","872":"An ultra-funny parody of the college life of George Lucas and how he was inspired to write the \"Star Wars\" trilogy.","873":"This DVD is fun. Not the best of all the Star Wars Satires I have seen, but certainly on of the few that focuses on George Lucas and his universe.\nDone to the tone of \"Shakespeare In Love\", this movie has cute moments, Star Wars inuendos and some clever diaglogue. The performances are very good too.\nIt's cute. For the Die Hard - Star Wars fan this is a must. Be warned, its very short!","878":"This was an excellent film.  Gosh, if only it could have been longer!  The commentary and the making-of pieces are equally as entertaining.\nThe other shorts on the DVD version leave a little to be desired.  But Lucas is great!","879":"This short film is a parody between Shakespeare in Love and Star Wars. The main plot is about young George Lucas in college and he's trying to come up with a great screenplay. Throughout his daily activities, we see where he gets his inspiration. Even though I didn't see Shakespeare in Love, I was still able to get most of the jokes. This is a VERY funny film and is worth watching over and over again. If you're a Star Wars fan, you might also want to try Hardware Wars.","884":"I watched this for the first time with a group of friends, all Star Wars fans. About half of us had seen Shakespeare in Love, but we'd all seen the various Star Wars movies many times. The movie produced gales of laughter.  Several times we had to stop and back up because we were unable to hear the  dialogue following one of the gags. I'd highly recommend this for any Star  Wars fans - it's definitely good for a laugh.","886":"THIS JUST IN: THE NOODLE HAS WON THE RACE!","888":"Props to the makers of this ingenious little movie.  To say anything is to give away all the gags, which are hilarious.  If you are a fan of Star Wars, there's really no reason not to love this short film.  My friend and  I about died laughing at some of the injokes.\nI guess my only complaint  would be that I wish it were longer, to satisfy my thirst for more of this  movie.","891":"Very Clever! Well Acted! A downright good time. Good god I sound like a jerk. But it was good.","892":"I've been hoping I would see this in a hardback book version as well! Full of humor and information on THE MAN George Lucas, himself, his films, and his life.\nGreat for fans of all his works or just the Star Wars saga  fans!","893":"Saw this orginally online and it spread like wildfire aroundthe office. Hysterical, with brilliant references and parodies. If itwas any more expensive I'd say pass but [at this price] you can't even buy a paperback. You get a few hours of fun as you play for every uninitiated person who visits your house.","899":"I wish CTV would consider reissuing \"Sesame Street\" as a chronological series, starting with \"Season One,\" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix.  The old shows were so wonderful... and that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen!","900":"Parents,\nI have not watched this tape that much but on Sesame Street Grover wants to be someone else. So all Grovers friends on Sesame Street cheer him up and show him how good he is. This is a great video for you and friends to watch.","901":"Parents,\nThis is a video tape with some comic mocvies for kids in it. My 8 year old loves Cookie Monster so I try to find video tapes that inclued him. Keep in mind you will think this is fummy to.","902":"Parents,\nIn this rare Sesame Street video they go to the Metropolitan Museum Of Art. My 8 year old boy loves Coookie Monster so I tried to find a tape that included him. Big Bird goes gets Suffy to leave the museum but when he comes back to all his friend they were stuck in the museum. Cookie Monster sees a picture but Cookie Monster sings a song to don't eat the pictures.","907":"Bought this for my 2 year old son.  He loves the songs and is learning to count along. From the parent's perspective, it's catchy but not terribly annoying, even when on the inevitable toddler repeat loop.","908":"Good","909":"ok","910":"Kids love it","911":"Can never go wrong with Sesame Street learning.","912":"Great","913":"Thank you","914":"Who does not like ernie. my nieces like the songs. Reminds me of my childhood","915":"My grandson loves it!!!!","916":"Again a great gift for a 4 year old.","917":"My 20 month old loves this film!!! He watches it and even tries to count with them. He knows the names of the characters too. It is a very colorful newer production as opposed to some of the films that have a bright cover but are really films from the early 90s. It does have a few throwback scenes in it which are all good. I would recommend this movie!!!","918":"According to my daughter the grandkids really enjoy this.  Morgan a bit more she is 3.  Carter is just going on 2 in June.","919":"My daughter likes this video... It isn't her favorite (she prefers Grover), but she enjoys watching it - Other posters complained about the bunny being rude - he IS short tempered, but it's more humorous than offensive (in my opinion)...","920":"daughter loved it when she was 2-3 yrs old, Its a childs DVD not sure what else to say its cute?  Helps them learn?","921":"My 2 year old daughter enjoys the songs, but the snarky and rude behavior modeled by Ernie and the bellhop is a bad example for her. Sesame Street, at its best, teaches children respect and kindness towards others. That's not only absent here, but what is shown is the opposite of how I would like my child to behave.","922":"I bought this for our 2 year old who is learning to count.  He loves it!  It really adds to our Sesame Street collection.","923":"Bought this for my daughter to go with the flash cards\/book and she loves it. If you have a child that loves Seasame Street this is for you. It is educational and keeps my 18 month old daughter interested. You can't go wrong with seasame street. This is a win in my books.","925":"I bought this for my daughter a month ago.  She is now 10 months.  She loves puppets so I though this would be a good fit.  She watches this video intently and loves it.  I find it entertaining.  I've seen it at least 2 dozen times.  I like Benny, the surly, angry rabbit who is the bellhop.  He keeps it entertaining for adults with his sarcastic quips.  Highly recommended if your kids like puppets.  It will keep them entertained while learning about numbers.","929":"You have to love Sesame Street-they consistently produce material that is child-friendly and educational.  The songs are catchy and it is a great tool for teaching numbers.  I did not give the video five stars because I think Benny is annoying, but that is just my opinion.","931":"I wish CTV would consider reissuing \"Sesame Street\" as a chronological series, starting with \"Season One,\" and working their way to the present... I would love to see the old episodes as they were originally broadcast, not with a few select bits chopped up into the new, modern mix. The old shows were so wonderful... plus that awful, whiny Elmo was nowhere to be seen! Anyway, that's my wish as a Sesame Street kid who now has a kid of my own... PS - yay, Ernie!","933":"My son loves this DVD. He is 11 months old and can't get enough of this program.  Even my 2 year old nephew can't get enough of it.  It's all Ernie so if you child doesn't care for Ernie, they may not sit and watch it.  It such a cute program with Benny the Bunny.  What a jokester! I think any kid would love it but again, it's all Ernie.","935":"This dvd does not keep my son's attention as well as other dvds out there (Baby Einstein, Richard Scary), but he does love the musical numbers & will dance with them. Obviously, the educational value is high, but I would have expected better from Sesame Street.","941":"My four-year old son just asked if he could watch this for the 3rd time in a row this evening. The little story line (Ernie is learning the routine in the Furry Arms, the local hotel) is entertaining for little kids-- as are the characters. Some are over-the-top, but with little kids, they *have* to be so the kids recognizee they're obnoxious.\nFor kids who avoid counting, this is a good way to sneak it in. They don't realize it's \"good for them\"!","943":"intense guitar lessons.","944":"Paul gilbert showing some of his favorite chops, a true innovator of the 80's\nguitar era with racer x\/mr.big and his solo work!!!!","947":"Paul is the master of fast guitar licks. I mean Wow!!\nhe teaching very valuable technique that is helping me improve my speed. I've got all the DVDs and bought them for my kids too! Thanks Paul!!!\nTommy G","948":"Perfect educational item for car. Daughter hates learning...lol this made it a little more bearable.","949":"This is a great history series. We love drive thru history as well as the kids. Very educational as well as entertaining .","950":"Excellent","951":"Dave Stotts takes individuals and elaborates on their contributions in history.  Has much information and great illustrations.  Dave has a great way of making it interesting and keeping your attention.  Great for all ages.  I highly recommend it.  Very well done.","952":"I love this workout. The set is beautiful. At first I thought it was going to be all down-dogs. I'm a lifelong migrainer and downdogs make myhead pound with pain. But there is so much after that!  It's a little slow, which is fine with me , but the workouts are very graceful and all of the poses I'm used to. It's a total body workout. I rented this, but I'm going to buy it!","955":"I love it, my whole family loves this. Very simple and easy to follow, each workout seems about 10 minutes in length!","956":"I thought I was watching an exercise video instead she's quoting the Bible. This is garbage, if I want to read the Bible I'll do it on my own time. very deceiving","957":"Wonderful relaxing program to follow.","958":"This was a great stretch routine with elements of yoga and sculpting that was not overly difficult or strenuous. I don't know if it earns it's \"Power\" in the title, but it was effective, especially if you aren't feeling high-energy, but want to get in some work. There is a little Bible-reference \"spiritual\" warm-up at the beginning.","959":"Didn't realize it was post-natal","960":"Not for me.","961":"I've always been skeptical of yoga, but this one actually made me break a sweat. It was also somehow easy enough that I could follow along.","962":"She is  OK.","963":"What was with all the Christian bullsh*?\n\nI guess they don't care about including the culture that developed these stretches...\n\nIt's all yoga, and that came from Hinduism. At least don't say anything so all cultures can participate w\/out feeling excluded.","964":"I used this dvd in my day off from exercise and It is very relaxing on my body, it makes me feel great, I really enjoyed it.","966":"No Problem","970":"I fondly imagined that this would be a gentle stretch to soothing music, so was rather challenged by quite a tough workout. One thing, do have a proper mat. My knees did not do well on a towel and I had to purchase a  good mat before I could repeat the workout. Further to other reviews, the  instructor's very affected speech patterns were annoying and distracting,  but not enough to take away from the fact that I will use this tape again  and again.","971":"Good movie for fans of Michael Crawford.","972":"Great fun!","973":"the problem with this film is theres no clear cut case of the villians are there really any villians in this film none that i could figure out. oliver reed s charcter krokov cant really be considered a villian primarily because theres no motive to any of what he does. from what i got out of him hes just a top russian agent with no real motive. films just a excuse to have great stunts and  a crazy plot that goes nowhere. see what you can salvage out of this one theres likeable stuff just no plot motivation.","974":"Just as I remember it when I watched it as a kid. Great nostalgia.","975":"I liked this movie, but it was predictable and simple. Although the plot was worn, I enjoyed most parts of the movie. The quality is decent and the movie is worth a try.","977":"love it very family friendly old fashioned like a Pollyanna movie with action.","978":"well done","979":"Best movie disney made in 1981...\nI saw it 32 times....\nMichael Crawford is the best actor and\nan awesome opera singer ...\nI'm getting the DVD...\nI had it on VHS...\nOMG","980":"fast and awesome product thank you.","981":"Our grandsons (10, 8, 7) and we watched it together. They had seen it once with their mother and were eager to share this with us. We had watched it when it first came out - with their mother! We had a blast. the kids enjoyed the innovation, they are all committed to becoming comic creators, and of course, who doesn't like the \"least likely\" to become the super-hero.","982":"I love this movie! The nerd gets the girl!","983":"An over looked Disney classic. great spoof on spy movies","985":"One of my husband's favorite movies","986":"Wow. Just as I remember.","987":"Great movie!  I think it is the best parody of superhero comic book movies.  I will not say anymore, just watch it!","988":"Great James Bond Spoof, corny humor but I love it.","989":"For those wondering it is not as good as you remember. Era of boring kids movies from Disney.","990":"Great classic movie! I always wanted to fly like he does with the wings.","991":"Great Disney movie.  This is not the best copy but good enough for us.  The movie is terrific of Disney, especially in the old days!","992":"Bought this for my husband and he loved it.","993":"Was pretty good for a dated movie.","994":"I watched this movie as a kid and was thoroughly entertained. This makes a great family movie that is fun and involves the watchers all the way through.","995":"A nice movie for the family to watch while getting the feel for James Bond storylines.  There's fancy gadgets, the pretty gal, disguises, explosions...and a bad guy who's just a bit scary.","996":"It was fun and adventurous.  A little romance. We all enjoyed this comedy adventure movie.  Full of surprises, too. Yes.","997":"I love this, it was packed well and exactly as pictured. i would recommend this product to anyone looking for something nice.","998":"I only wish that I had bought the movie rather than rented it!  Great film of good vs. evil.  Love it!","999":"This one is great!, if you haven't seen it, it is totally worth purchasing, My kids were cracking up when they were watching it!","1000":"I ordered this for my grands, ages 6 & 7 and they love it!  Thank you for creating the instant purchase.  It filled a \"snow day\".","1001":"This is a rather old movie but still fund to watch. Fun kids movie that will keep the parents watching.","1002":"Before he was The Phantom of the Opera, he was Woody (better known as Condorman) and before Barbara Carrera was Fatima Blush [007's Never Say Never (Again)], Barbara Carrera was Woody's love interest, Natalia--she was a looker back then. Condorman really did protect us from those Commies!","1003":"Condarman is one of Disney's more brilliant films in the last few decades. The story has the taste of Peter Sellers classic \"Pink Panther\" movies and that special \"80's\" movie magic that hollywood hasn't been able to replicant since.\n\nSuperhero films are big in Hollywood right now, though I doubt they'd make a reboot of this movie a part of me is glad they won't. This classic can hold it's own without the need for any blockbuster A-lister or CGI effects.\n\nBuy it. Watch it. Love it. Thank me afterwards.","1004":"I thought I buying a copy and not paying a ten dollars for a playing of condor man.  It's a good movie but not that good.  Besides I have a\ncopy on vhs. Sorry I messed up.  I will give it one star because of the price.","1005":"I gave it four stars, what else is important? This whole idea that you MUST add words to a review makes me not want to bother.","1006":"This movie is corny and just fun. With improved technology of today, I would love to see a remake. A comic book comes to life.","1007":"I loved this as a kid and i still manage a few laughs now. It is a pretty cheesy movie but I guess I  like a bit of cheese.\nI hear they are making a new movie of this and I am sure it will be action packed.\nThe story is ok, Michael Crawfords American accent is terrible but  I just keep coming back to watch it.\nI did like the gagets and the disguises - funny.","1008":"I have not been able to purchase this movie yet. I rented the movie to watch since I grew up with it. I absolutely love the movie and wish I could find it for a cheaper price. I hope it will be released on Blu-ray. Will rent again if still available sometime.","1009":"I'm buying classic moves.  I remember this from long ago and since I liked it then, I bought it so others could watch it.","1011":"One of my favorite movies of my youth. It was one that the whole family enjoyed. A good movie to take me back.","1014":"A movie from my childhood. I saw this all the time. Its alittle cheesy but still holds up as a great movie.","1015":"Having seen the movie years ago, I was pleasantly surprised to see it in DVD.  DVD was in excellent condition but movie itself could have been clearer but that may be due to the technology used at the time of filming.","1017":"I rented the film for $1.99 because I found the sale price way too high.  It's a charming, funny, lighthearted spoof of the secret agent genre.  I'm a big Michael Crawford fan and this is the only work available where he's not lost in the character like Forum or Dolly. I wish he'd done more film work post-Phantom of the Opera. He has a true gift for comedy.","1019":"great, clean 4 the whole family. any adult that liked the old pink panther movies will like this as well.","1023":"It is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It has some humorous parts too. I think it is a movie everyone could enjoy.","1025":"i love this movie, my second fav old video.\n\nfast car chases, cool car gadgets, and a good sense\n\nof humor. tops james bond any day....","1028":"This is defintly a movie that the whole family will enjoy. Michael Crawford is just wonderful in it. I highly recommend this film. I'd give it ten stars if I could.","1036":"I agree with the previous reviewer that the preview is stupid; it's actually the first 2 mins and credits of the film.  However, I have seen the full movie several times and I think this is an outstanding version of \"Great Expectations.\" The final scene really packed an emotional wallop for me, unlike some of the other versions. Good cast, classy production.","1037":"I am thrilled to have found this version of \"Great Expectations\".I am a big fan of Charles Dickens - and of Ioan Guffudd, and I found it at Amazon.com","1052":"of this version of the classic.  So dark and mysterious yet the costuming was lush and beautiful.  It felt a bit rushed at some points, but the character portrayals were extremely well done.  Highly recommend this one with Great Expectations.","1053":"Filmed well , but not realistic! The two protagonist would of killed each other @ the start!","1054":"A US and a Japanese soldier were marooned together on a Pacific Island . Only these 2 soldiers are in this WWII flick.\nIt is well done and filled with excitement. I know you will like it as I did.","1055":"2 great actors","1058":"as expected.","1059":"Hell in the Pacific staring Lee Marvin and TosHiro Mifune there are only two actors in this movie but they are great its a wonderful movie witch proves if these two can get along any body can excellent Blu-ray.","1061":"one of the best movies I've ever seen. this DVD was grainier than the original movie.","1062":"Definitely a strange movie.  Being a Lee Marvin fan I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The character development between\nthe 2 soldiers was great.  The ending had me wondering.  After watching I researched and read several reviews and\nlearned about the alternate endings. That kind of helped me understand the movie better as I wasn't the only one\nthat had mixed emotions about how it ended.","1063":"great","1064":"One of my father's and mine favorite movies, but none of my friends agrees!","1065":"This was not one of his better movies.  Kinda boring.  It was sent on time and in good condition.  I normally like Woody Allen movies.  Take the movie and run away.","1066":"This the first Woody Allen I saw in a theater and still think it is vey nearly his funniest.  Some of the gags have their origin in his standup comedy repertoire.  In his routine he jokes about how five inmates chained at the ankles snuck past the guard posing as an immense charm bracelet.\n\nThe processing in blu-ray is excellent.","1067":"Classic early Woody","1068":"I had fond memories of TTMAR. So I watched it for the first time in 30 years. Now I find the movie lacking. TTMAR is very funny at times but the romance part did nothing for me (the scenes seem reminiscent of other late 60's movies I haven't watched in some time either. A man and a woman, Two for the Road?) and the gags are both too erratic and too far in between.","1070":"I remember this movie from the 1070's, it is so funny","1071":"great old movie","1073":"Epic film considering Marvin was wounded during his service in the Pacific as a marine. He was there and did that without treatment for PTSD","1074":"Thanks","1076":"A classic.","1077":"Love this movie. I read about the personal relationship that developed between these two actors during the making of the film and you can see it progress throughout the movie. Lee Marvin was a combat Marine in the Pacific during WWII and makes this a very realistic film.","1078":"Best Woody Allen ever :)","1079":"Not surprised. Big fan of woody Allen. Good comedy and good acting. Highly recommend","1080":"By far the FUNNIEST Woody Allen movie ever made..","1081":"A classic. One of Woody's best!","1082":"I love everything Woody Allen does in the movies and this is just a great example. I hope he makes many more movies before he casts off this mortal coil we call ' life'!","1083":"GREAT BUY  . UNABLE TO FIND TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN ANYWHERE ELSE.","1084":"I had a time follwing the plot in this movie and it seem that the movie didn't go anywhere","1085":"AWESOME!","1086":"A Christmas gift for my son. I'll probably never see it","1088":"AS expected","1089":"good entertainment","1090":"You won't stop laughing","1092":"Funney","1093":"Great seller, fast shipping and product just as described. Highly recommended.","1095":"I bought this video specifically to see my all time favorite Scottish actor, Tony Curran, play the sinister serial killer, Emerson. I was not disappointed by any of the three episodes in this set, however. I recommend this video to any fan of cop drama and\/or mysteries.","1096":"Hell of a flick.","1097":"An interesting movie","1098":"I remembered watching this movie years ago and loving it. It never came on TV much at all over the years, so I had to have the DVD. It is a great story told with very few words. It's amazing how entertaining it is without much speaking. Great acting by both men.","1099":"Fascinating film diverging from most war flicks in its presentation of the protagonists and their eventual grudging accommodation to their circumstances. Withheld a fifth star as I didn't like the ending.","1100":"Very satisfied.","1101":"great movie!","1102":"Lee Marvin & Actor  Toshiro Mifune  Are OUTSTANDING In This DRAMA.  They are Two Enemies Trapped Alone in a Desert Island.  BOTH Of Their Performances  were Well Etched\/  A Searing Psychological Drama!!!!  A MUST SEE ON A VERY LARG SCREEN!!!  It Should Be Shown On an I-MAX Screen!!!!!!!!!","1103":"The incomparable Lee Marvin and the talented Toshiru Mifune star in the interesting WWII tale of an American GI and a Japanese soldier stranded together on an island in the South Pacific during WWII.","1104":"Great Woody Allan flick still going strong into the future","1105":"Woody Allen's uneven crime mockumentary marked his directorial debut. Despite its rough-edged quality, \"Take the Money and Run\" (1969) maintains a steady flow of visual and verbal humor. Allen successfully develops his comic persona in his first starring role. Even by today's standards, the film holds up better than most of Woody's recent output. Strangely out of print, the Anchor Bay DVD includes widescreen and full-screen versions.","1106":"Classic slapstick humor movie by Woody Allen. Silly. Funny.","1107":"Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run is one of my favorites amount his great movies.  It is hilarious!  I love it!","1109":"this movie is more than the sum of all the other films about world war two combined. it is a true classic. both men are superb and make us believe what has been said in the past: \"that all wars begin and end within the hearts of men.\"","1110":"Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune (you may remember him from Seven Samurai) with only one chance for survival, very entertaining.","1111":"What's not to like? Except the ending...Jesus, who wrote that ending? Marvin a real Marine in WWII who actually killed Japanese on Guadalcanal as a 19 year old, played a total realistic part. Mifume, the greatest actor to ever come out of Japan plays a smart realistic soldier. I cannot add more that what others have written on here.","1113":"This is an excellent movie if you are a lee Marvin fan you will like this overlooked movie. Good plot and makes good use of the area where they filmed from.","1114":"This is an interesting take on a more personal view on warfare - as Lee Marvin was a marine in real life in WWII.","1115":"Should make it clearer in the description that it won't play on any domestic player. Tried to cancel order just a few hours after sending but got it anyway.\n\nSeller was fine, quick shipping and decent packing but what good is that if the item is not usable in this country. Should list these items in a separate section. Very disappointing. Have sent it back.","1117":"Some may not agree that this was his best but I found it hysterical.\nI found it pure fun as I don't remember it having any political or heavy social comments as most of his films do.","1119":"Excellent study of a American Navy pilot and a enemy Japanese Army soldier stranded on a small Pacific island during WWII.  They combat each other with whatever natural weapons that can be found and then realize  their surrival depends on their cooperation.","1120":"5 Stars = Masterpiece\n\n\"Hell in the Pacific\" is one of the greatest movies of it's ilk. Can't even begin to remember the first time I watched it, most likely not long after it was made. A true portrait of two men fighting a war on opposite sides, that only know their on opposite sides, but find out what it is to know your opponent, who may not necessarily be your enemy.\n\nEssential veiwing","1121":"John Boorman's visualizes Robert S. McNamara's eleventh lesson of life and war; i.e., \"...empathize with your enemy to better understand and combat him\" and takes that notion to the extremes in this fabulous, intense movie metaphor.  Two soldiers -- American and Japanese (movie icons Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifuni) -- stranded on a South Pacific island, determined to fight to the death, instead discover life. A truly great war movie.  And ironically, a greater anti-war movie.","1122":"I love the view (and the story) of the island.  It's played by 2 top actors.","1123":"I've never seen a worse comedy.  It has a promising idea (that a criminal would fail at every turn) but is so tightly over scripted that you can't even laugh in the wrong places.  There are none of the quirky truthful insights about real life that \"Annie Hall\" later had.  Woody Allen must be an absolutely humorless person.  The only good thing that can be said is that this failure forced him to go in a different direction.","1124":"Played fine on my US Spec Blu Ray player but it is not widescreen, it is only 4:3 letterbox. Wait until the actual blu ray comes out.","1125":"This is another, funny interesting comedy from Woody Allen in the vein of his early work. Good stuff. Great comedic style in classic Allen fashion.","1128":"The Bottom Line:\n\nOne of the few films I can name with only two actors, Hell in the Pacific takes two of the world's most forceful actors (Lee Marvin and Toshiro Mifune) and casts them as enemies stranded on the same island in the Pacific with no idea of the other's language; something like the Twilight Zone episode \"Two\" without the romance, Hell in the Pacific is an interesting and unique film.","1131":"this is the JOHN BOORMAN i love . the director of \"DELIVERANCE\" and \"THE EMERALD FOREST\" in addition to this excellent and haunting film . in his twin outstanding lead actors , a very thoughtful screenplay and breathtaking photography and direction , it all comes together for me . i withhold the fifth star as i am conflicted about the ending . that was john's artistic choice though . i don't do alternate endings .","1135":"Woody Allen's directorial debut, and it's still funnier than many of his later movies.  You know, he tended toward introspection over comedy in later years.  At the time I ordered, this import was the only widescreen version (zone 0) available in north america.  Sure, it has some korean styled packaging, but you still get english audio and subtitles.  The movie itself is is fresh comedy from a guy making a funny movie, not a commercial movie.  Beware, this movie contains prison scenes and carved soap.","1136":"Take the Money and Run is a very funny Woody Allen comedy released in 1969 between What's Up Tiger Lily? and Bananas. This excellent Korean transfer is the only widescreen version of the film available. There are some extra features available if your Korean is better than mine (non-existent).\nIf you liked Sleeper and Love and Death, Allen's best early comedies, you will like this one.","1140":"There is no one better than Woody to portray a schmuck. This poor shlep could not do anything right no matter what. I love Ms. Margolin and her untimely demise is heart breaking. That last scene when he asked \"Do you know if it's raining\" classic Woody.","1149":"Although it may not have been the BEST ending to this otherwise fascinating look at the humanity of war. Nonetheless this is a very enjoyable and intriging look at an awkward turn of events for two enemies forced to confront their foe on solitary terms. The ending was war itself.  Irony. Tragedy. Ending.","1150":"Allen's first film as director, not the one of his best, but a good start to his brilliant career. All charasteristics of his ego are here seeding. After this about one movie a year which is pretty incredible. I hope he keeps going.","1152":"The Bottom Line:\n\nA free-wheeling comedy by Allen, made before Annie Hall ushered in his more serious phase, Take the Money and Run offers a lot of laughs in a short period of time; its humor is not always sophisticated, but it should crack you up quite a bit.","1153":"Probably the least funny of the old Woody Allen films that I've been re-visiting.  Although I really did like the scene where he is given an experimental vaccine and suffers the unusual, \"Side effects of turning into a rabbi for several hours.\"","1154":"I can't stop laughing whenever I remember this movie. Have seen it dubbed in Persian language too and it was even more hilarious. Though I was curious to see the actual English language version and it was even funnier. gosh, this guy is brilliant. Loved it.... I think Woody Allen is a neurotic comedian and this work of him is among the best comedies I have seen. Good job 5\/5","1156":"This is a hilarious, slapstick gem. It has some of Allen's best lines, a few incredibly entertaining situations and is one of his funniest comedies. This is a very funny movie, strongly recommended.\n\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Sherlock-Holmes-and-the-Flying-Zombie-Death-Monkeys\/dp\/1906669023\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys<\/a>","1161":"This is one of the funniest Woody Allen films. I don't know why it was released in full screen and that is why I deduct one star. One of Woody's less complex comedies, but still one of my favorites. The DVD transfer looks good, but a widescreen version should have been included.","1163":"Not bad for Woody Allen in his first movie as star,director and writer! It is outrageously funny from start to finish. Add Jackson Beck's narration and you have the makings for a fun,humorous narration on the life and times of Virgil Starkwell, the mastermind of crime! I thought this was a winner when I first saw it several years ago and it is still funny!","1166":"Very funny for Woody's first full length feature.  He's an incompetant bank robber and his wife is a laundress.  Enjoy!","1176":"This has to be one of the funniest movies ever made. When I first seen it was a Woody Allen movie, I didn't have high expectations. I decided to sit through it anyways. And, to my surprise I actually laughed through most of the entire movie. The documentary type style was the greatest idea. If you love irony this is a great movie to see. Heck, if you love to laugh this is a great movie to see. I give this one a big stamp of approval and I don't do that for many movies","1177":"I'm a great Woody Allen's fan but I believe he offer us three types of movies. 1. Kind of serious movies 2. Nice comedies with great dialogues and history 3. Hilarious comedies. The last type are my type. If you've seen one of the following listed below, you MUST see the others: Love and Death, Bananas, Take the Money and Run, Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask, Anie Hall, Sleeper, A Midsummer Night's Comedy and Zelig. Garanteed laughs !","1178":"The counter scene when Allen's character says he is robbing the bank and has a \"gub\".  That is hilarious!! Many more humorous scenes!\nOne of America's best comics ever!!","1180":"This film introduced a film generation to Woody Allen as film maker. A parody of a documentary about a bumblingcrook, its a loosely pieced together series of bits. Some miss the mark, but many are flat out hysterical. Woody robbing the bank (with the teller unable to correctly read his robbery note) and Woody on a chain gang are highlights.","1182":"Take The Money & Run is the first film that featured the Woody Allen triple threat of writing, directing and starring.  The film is set as a documentary on the life of the worst criminal of all-time, Virgil Starkwell, who never pulled off a successful crime in his life.  The film is a fast-paced and sharply written.  It sets up the Woody Allen persona, the likable loser, that he would portray in most of his subsequent films.  Take The Money & Run is an excellent start to a movie legend's fabled career.","1185":"I liked the almost-documentary style that this was shot in. Funniest gag scene is when Woody is chained up with other cons(I nearly busted a gut on that one!). Watch what happens to Woody's soap gun as he almost escapes  from the prison! This one is just downright funny, and does not  include(which I still like) the philosophical discussions on life, death,  sex,etc. This one is hilarious and is superior to Banannas.","1186":"This is the best of Woody Allen's strictly-for-laughs movies.  The interview segments which he uses for both comedic and dramatic purposes in many of his films are probably the most fun here, particularly his  \"parents\" who wear disguises.  The gags are much better than in  his \"Bananas\" and the more than slightly silly plot doesn't bog  down as in his \"Sleeper\".  There are no big moral soapboxes, this  movie is just funny.","1188":"My child love it and sings the song all the time","1189":"Gets kids excited for potty training. My 2 year old loves watching it, especially after having the book for a while, then seeing it played out. The only thing I can't get over, is the voice they chose for Hannah.... She sounds like an adult.. a burly one.. Other than that it's great!","1190":"My three year old watched it, she sings it, and about two weks later she was doim=ng number 1 & 2 in the potty. I'm gonna start having my two year old watch it.","1191":"kids loved it!","1192":"Bought this video to encourage my 16 months old daughter to start using potty. Unlike other videos, both of us don't seem to be interested in watching the video very often. The voice of Hannah sounds weird, not quite sure it is a sound of a male or a female and sounds no innocence of a young child. Hearing the voice of Hannah bothers me a lot. The tone sounds very flat, like \"Hannah\" is reading the script.\n\nThe music is catchy but the song is boring. I cannot bare to listen to it more than 3 times.","1193":"Our three-year-old toddler asks to see the Potty Movie when she visits her Nana, and likes me to read her the companion book. I believe the movie and book have helped her with potty training, but they also show Hannah learning to brush her teeth, dress herself, and perform other \"big girl\" tasks that toddlers must learn.","1197":"It's a classic!!!","1198":"Totally met expectations","1199":"I like this series.  I have enjoyed every episode I have watched.  Look forward to more.  It's old but the content is still very relevant.  Good show!","1200":"This is my second time through this wonderful production.  I watched it all for the first time a few years back.  I have come to feel like part of both the upstairs and the downstairs characters on my second time through. I even feel a little British.  I can't stop watching and am sorry it's coming to an end on my second time around.","1201":"love this show as I learn history (just like Downton Abbey).... though sometimes the storylines jump from one period to the other and was hard to follow..wish though some of the characters had lived happier lives..all in all a good show and time piece from the era...","1202":"Bravo!","1203":"I am still enjoying the series.  I always look forward to what the characters are up to","1204":"Nice to watch this great classic show again. Many of the eps are available via YT, the ones that aren't I am purchasing here for the very reasonable price of 1.99 per ep. Picture and sound quality are excellent via Amazon.","1205":"We love it","1206":"Enjoyed the whole series","1207":"very interesting","1208":"Love this show","1209":"love it","1210":"Good condition, quick ship, good price, thank you.","1211":"I truly enjoyed the series!  Very entertaining-good acting!  I would recommend this series to any one.","1212":"I have thorouthly enjoyed the entire series. Have two or three more episodes in Season 4 to go, can't wait for #5. I feel like I'm right\nthere with the family as I watch all the \"goings-on\".","1213":"I enjoyed all episodes and it's good to see how the English lived through WWI.  They had a much harder time of it since the war came to their homeland.  Hazel is my favorite character.","1214":"The only disappointment was when Meg Wynn Owen Left the series. Although married to somewhat disagreeable James, Hazel could hold her own, and had more compassion for the servants Downstairs. Lord Bellamy needed a wife, so Virginia was added to replace Hazel. Edward and Daisy were a cute couple. Rose was just as loyal as ever. Mrs. Bridges was always proud of her kitchen art. Hudson was a snob, and Ruby was a likeable dimwit.","1215":"Very well done. I had heard people talking allot about this during it'd time but did not get to watch it till now. The characters were wonderful. I became so involved that there were times I cried. A really top drawer series.","1216":"I love this show!  I now remember why I loved this program.  Downton Abbey would not be as successful if this program had not been made","1217":"Season 4 is pretty good, but somewhat sad as well.  There are some very good performances by  members of the cast .","1218":"Loved this series.  Watched all the seasons and must say had a wonderful journey through time.  A lot of the story I had missed when originally saw it on PBS.  Such a fantastic cast and presentation of the Victorian Era.","1220":"After the very first episode, I was unable to stop and continued to watch all the Seasons every chance I got. Superb story lines, excellent acting. Love watching movies in that era and seeing how they cooked every meal from scratch and by hand without any modern conveniences. The cooks spent their entire day in the kitchen making meals.  Interesting to realize how many cooking products we have today to lessen our time in the kitchen!","1221":"I have not yet finished with the whole  Season 4. The characters become like old friends. .I love history I am disappointed that Season 5 is not available for prime time members at no additional cost.","1222":"Done with season four.  Only one more season to go...wahhhh!  I so love this program...best I've ever seen!  Enjoy it!","1223":"We love this series and have watched it several times. It is great fun as well as an interesting look at turn of the Century Britain.  Definitely Time well-wasted!","1224":"I LOVE this series!  The characters are very well-written and well-acted.  I am transported back in time to WWI and love the story lines with the different people in the house.  This show brings history alive in a very entertaining way.  I usually watch an entire episode while I am walking on my treadmill and I get my exercise without even realizing it!  LOVE, love, love it!!","1225":"It is always sad to hear, read, and or see how the World War I and II impacted people's lives.  Learned a bit more of history watching this show.","1226":"I thoroughly enjoy the series. Love the characters and the era it is set in. It is all great entertainment. Very sad to see some of the characters go. but, really like some of the new ones.","1227":"In the 70's I was living mostly out of the country or away from a television.  I enjoy Brittish drama and humor so this was a good way for me to catch up on an old classic.  I think they have done a great job of capturing the essence of the time in the early 1900's and have given it a lot of heart.","1228":"I have never considered this kind of life, especially the servants. An eye opening series! Addicting to watch, but interesting.","1229":"England is at war and all of the household is impacted too.  Follow both the upstairs and the downstairs during the war to end all wars.","1230":"Most of this season was boring for me. Mainly because I got tired of James character and he began to annoy me. The other story lines were interesting.","1231":"I absolutely love  the stories going on both Upstairs and Downstairs! Can't believe is was written and filmed so long ago, yet the stories just pull you right in! Am about to enter the 5th Season, and am a little sad, that this is the last Season. Love, love love the characters!","1232":"I LOVE this show. I am enjoying it more watching it 20 years later. The filming, sets, costuming may not be as opulent as Downton Abbey, but the story line, is much, much better.\nON MY TOP TEN LIST OF FAVORITE TV SERIES OF ALL TIME.","1233":"LOVE THIS!  UPSTAIRS DOWNSTAIRS IS AN AWESOME CLASSIC!  I LOVE BRITISH TV.  NOT TOO EXPLICIT AND VERY INTRIGUING.  THANK YOU","1234":"I am a big fan of the Series Upstairs, Downstairs.  Season 4 is very good.  The serious nature of World War I on London is so interesting and well done. The actors are very good in this series.","1235":"I don't remember what famous person made the quote \"War is Hell\".  It is an accurate statement, of course.  Season 4 of the Bellamy's follows them through the first World War.  I am sure that the scripts were historically accurate. Season 4 upholds the series tradition of EXCELLENT acting, plots, and production quality.  I could not give 5 stars because I found the amount of time and detail devoted to war-time plots became a little depressing.","1236":"Season 4 continues at the same high level as the earlier episodes. It is amazing that after almost 40 years this series is still so fresh -- and relevant.","1237":"Entertaining, nonviolent, real life in the 1920s England. A lot like Downton abbey in theme, and still very different. Very good.","1238":"It was good to receive the fourth season after watching the first two seasons. It's good to see the aristocratic Bellamy family, along with the servants, do their part to aide the war wounded. Can't wait to purchase the fifth season.","1239":"Being a half Brit, this series brought back many things. My mother used to sing one of the songs in the series. The story had many ups  and downs as well a lot of laughs. I hope our children appreciate how easy they have it.","1240":"After three seasons most shows have really started to wind down.\nThe same is true about this series, but it doesn't mean there aren't a few stories left to tell.","1241":"The stories might be from the past but are able to relate to them in the presence.  It's nice to have entertainment that isn't tainted with profanity and nudity.  Wish all tv shows could be at this quality.","1242":"I like to follow the story of how these people adap to life during wars, romance and death.  I like to think that life was really like that.","1243":"two thumbs up! Great watch..the whole dang thing is just great..will watch again with no problem!\nHoly crap a great watch! now is that enough words?","1245":"I loved every episode and couldn't wait to watch the next one!  In fact I have watched in several times over.","1246":"I did not watch this movie..we saw the trailors and it was ordered through a glitch in our computer when trying to order or pre order a 4TH season of Downton Abby. Sorry, but we won't be watching it either.","1247":"What can I say - I got sucked into the characters in Season 1, and just couldn't stop watching.  Was very sad when I had finished the last season.  Wanted to know more.  Love the sweetness of Rose, and of course, Hudson's voice....  Enjoy","1248":"I enjoyed this series.  I had never seen it in the 70's but heard a lot about it.  I am so glad I tuned in.  Timeless.","1254":"Having been a fan of this show since the early 70's, I truly am amazed on how the show still holds up today! Season 4 was not one of my favorite years for the show, although the cast almost stayed the same, with the exeption of a few new one's, it built up to Season 5, the last year for the series. It is still a good show to watch, and a splendid period piece as well.","1255":"The Bob Newhart Show was one of the 10 best TV shows ever, and the picture quality in this 6-tape collection is very good. It's nice to see all the episodes in their uncut form, as opposed to the reprehensible syndication practice of cutting scenes to sell more commercial time. My only qualm with this collection is that there are only 2 episodes per tape. Hopefully there will be a DVD collection of this excellent series and the follow-up series, Newhart (1982-1990).","1256":"The funniest Season of all Bob Newhart Shows !","1257":"Great classic sitcom","1258":"GREAT PRODUCT FAST DELIVERY","1260":"Last season, not so funny.","1263":"funny","1264":"One of my all time favorite shows and all time favorite actor. No problem with any of the recordings, just some great TV. I bought both Newhart series and have enjoyed watching them both.","1265":"classic tv","1266":"Funny very happy !!","1267":"Excellent!","1268":"all went well...thanks","1269":"Great series","1270":"The most looked-forwarded to movie of the year for me. Now, the one I hope I can forget the quickest.  I blame it all on the director. Who in Hollywood pays these imbeciles to make a movie like this. How in the world  could anyone ruin a movie starring Fiennes, Connery, Thurman? - Totally  beyond my comprehension. If anyone out there knows  a place I can get an  elective frontal lobotomy, please let me know. Do a service to one in deep  suffering.","1272":"One of my favorite comedy shows.  Bob Newhart is tops. No dirty jokes - which I prefer.  Good clean fun!","1273":"good.","1274":"Love the Bob Newhart show. Tons of laughs. Great family entertainment. Brings back good ole wonderful memories back from the 70's.","1275":"Grew up watching The Bob Newhard Show every Saturday night with my family, wonderful to be able to enjoy the laughter all over again.","1276":"Newharts dry sense of humor is one of the many reasons the show is funny and entertaining","1277":"great thanks","1278":"Not much else to say but that it is one of the best classic shows on television.","1280":"Losing some steam and pooping out.  And episodes without Bob?  It was time to call it a day.  And back then I believed they had already.  Didn't know it was still on that year at the time.","1281":"Loving my new Bob Newhart Show DVDs.  This show is a classic gem and is one of my favorites. Great cast, great acting and the humor is timeless. You won't be disappointed.","1282":"Good.","1283":"Good movie. Shipped fast.","1284":"Patrick McNee has a bit part in this film. Reason enough to have a copy.  The movie tried to add too much of the quirks old series that made it  campy. This DVD has the version that was in the theaters.","1285":"I cannot believe Sean Connery would put himself into such a horrible film","1286":"cool","1287":"One of the coolest TV shows from a time when there was something on that didn't insult your intelligence.","1288":"This is a very fun movie. I love the characters.","1289":"One of my favorite shows. Very Satisfied. Thanks.","1291":"Some DVDs disc didn't work","1292":"excellent","1293":"Was ok, the sound did not work on my blue ray\/ streaming content player","1294":"After renting the movie I wanted it for my library. By movie standards it isn't Oscar material, however, it was fun and I totally love Ralph Fiennes in this one.","1295":"Definitely not up to the standards of the TV series. Ralph Fiennes is a second rate John Steed. Uma Thurman is a little better as Emma Peele but making her an expert in every science is a little much. Having two people running the agency is too much. Having the man code named Mother and the woman code named Father is too cute by far.","1296":"Great Transaction! Awesome Merchandise!","1297":"Wow! This is a terrible movie!","1298":"perfect","1299":"It is a gift for my husband","1300":"Look great and sound good.....the final season....tv isn't this cool anymore","1301":"Great series, great comedian.","1302":"This show is one of the classics: it's humor is hip, intelligent, sometimes surreal. the cast is absolutely perfect. With so little sit-com type shows on tv these days, do yourself a favor and invest in this for many hours of feel-good comedy.","1303":"Now we have them all.","1304":"The show speaks for itself. The package and disc setup is good","1306":"Finally! I've been waiting a long time for this season of The Bob Newhart Show!","1307":"dvd in good shape if you love the avengers you will love this.  linda thorson as tara king every bit as good as dianna rig as mrs peel.  one of the best tv shows ever made","1308":"This was the biggest bomb\n\nthere are only 1 Emma Peel and 1 John Steed,,,,Diana Rigg and Patrick MacNee  RIP\n\nnext time you want to try a film.....based on series use them which can be no longer done RIP PATRICK MAGNEE  and forget the hacks","1309":"Exactly what I expected!","1310":"Loved it!!!","1311":"no comment","1312":"You simply must have this series.  You'll want to watch it again, and again.  Great Bob....thanks for your timeless humor.  Dave (in Colorado)","1313":"Great TV classic.","1314":"I received the dvds on time, and in great shape. As for the content of the dvds, I was surprised by how little Bob was in the episodes in this last season. I didn't remember that from when it was on tv. It is still an excellent show, and I'm very glad to finally have this entire series in my collection. Thank you Mr. Newhart.","1315":"FAVORITE SHOW OF ALL TIME...BRINGS ME BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD","1316":"Still funny after all these years. Takes you back to a simpler time when humor didn't involve profanity. Always have and always will enjoy this show.","1317":"These old Bob Newhart shows don't have the quality of writing or wit of \"Frasier\"  or \"Everyone loves Raymond.\"That being said, it was fun seeing the styles and designs from the era.","1318":"Great","1319":"Dumb!!!","1320":"While not entirely true to the classic TV series, this movie is very true to the theme of an ultra-British spy spoof.  The villain's house is VERY well-appointed, and the heroes have an interesting way of crossing the Thames to go after him.  It's just too bad that the film makes for a tricky search, with all the Marvel superhero films showing up.  It's worth finding!","1321":"love it","1322":"GREAT COMPLETLY","1324":"GREAT\nGREAT\nGREAT","1325":"Good show featuring the very funny Bob Newhart. This completes my collection and will be enjoyed as part of a marathon.","1326":"Love this original series...great cast, fun writing, and good acting.  No Bob Newhart fan should do without this series!","1327":"One of the best investments made.","1328":"I grew up watching this sitcom. Bob Newhart is one of the best comedians!! His delivery is just so smooth. It was awesome to see the old gang again. I know he went on to some other shows, but this one is classic! Marcia Wallace;  Peter Bonerz; Suzanne Pleshette and the supporting cast mates are going to live on for ever!!","1329":"Finally!!!","1330":"One of the greatest TV shows of all-time! Love Bob! Great cast! Great writing! Funny, funny, funny!","1331":"none","1332":"one of the most original cast of characters","1333":"Owned first 4 seasons on standalone dvd season sets. When Bob was MIA season 5 mid way and season 6 mostly....the humor was a struggle to keep excitement as high in the series.  It reinforced why this sitcom lost steam when it's main star was absent. Like extras. But this series jumped the sharp tail end of season 5.","1334":"Love Bob Newhart and this show.  Still needs subtitles or captioning for us seniors and veterans.","1335":"A bit goofy, and not like the series but well in the spirit.","1337":"Received as expected.","1338":"I love the Avengers,  Although I like Emma Peel more than Tara King. I would like to buy more 68 volumes but they are priced to high. I am hoping they come out with a whole 1968 package for a reasonable price.","1339":"I've always loved this movie!","1340":"Quite a few reviews were pretty negative.  I found the film not great but a clever parody.  Opening art work was a 'take-off' of all the \"007\" openings.  Don't look for an action flick tho it has that.  Enjoy the subtulties, the double meanings, and the wit.\n\nI don't usually watch videos a 2nd time but this could be one that I do.  Just to enjoy the clever playing against each other.","1341":"OK","1342":"Good DVD condition","1343":"Wonderful movie.","1344":"A bit dull but Ralph makes it exciting!","1345":"Wow, this flick is one of my all-time favs! I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like it. Outstanding - if they had a six star rating, I would give it that. Superb. And OMG, I am in love with Uma Thurman. Heavy, heavy sigh.......","1347":"Seeing Sean Connery in such a silly role is kind of worth it just as proof that it actually happened. Otherwise, I was surprised to see that Eddie Izzard is in this as well but is completely wasted as they gave him only one line in the entire movie - come on, he is a stand-up comedian!\n\nAnyway, silly story, not greatly acted, and sub-par pacing makes this one to avoid for the most part.","1348":"Always liked this movie and wanted my own copy of it, finally got around to buying it.  Good quality DVD, plays well.","1349":"ok","1350":"Great Show Very Funny","1351":"shout factory knows how to produce a great DVD","1352":"This is one of the classic series from the 1970's and you are sure to enjoy it.  I also clearly remember  playing a drinking game we came up with whilst watching the show.  Anytime someone said \"Hi Bob\" you had to take a drink.","1353":"The Bob Newhart show is always a winner no matter that it is now many decades later.  The humor is still fresh today.","1357":"What an awful movie!  It reached a climax and then went another 20 minutes.  Uma Thurmond doesn't have the charisma of Diana Riggs.","1358":"Ralph Feinnes and Uma Thurmond gave a workmanlike performance in this show.  It had a copule of nods to the original series, with Patrick McNee playing the invisible archivist and the show ending with the original Avengers theme. The overall flavor of the performance was more like Jame Bon, with the constant sexual innuendo (a crutch for mediocre writers) and less intelligent dialogue than the original.","1359":"Yeah I loved the movie version of Avengers with Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes Sean Connery had a great part also as Sir August dewinter.","1360":"Pure garbage, I will not waste any more words on this cinematic rubbish. Do yourself a major favor if you have been brave enough to watch this crap all the way through,immediately afterwards watch an original \"The Avengers\" episode it will help cleanse your soul!","1361":"I got this to replace an old vhs copy, love it! Sometimes the oldies really are the ones to watch!","1362":"Love Bob Newhart in his classic 70's sitcom!","1363":"I'm so excited to own the whole series. I love this show and highly recommend to all fans of it to buy this set.","1364":"I love this show i can't say that enough! I have watched it over and over and still laugh. Great dvd set","1365":"Just because I don't write a comprehensive review doesn't mean my rating is less important.","1366":"prompt delivery and as described","1367":"I love the show and have the whole series. It and myself are oldies but goodies. Very Camp and for its day original. One of the first British made shows to be a hit in a the USA.","1368":"I like British stuff. I like spies...but this movie kept putting me to sleep; however, there was this one bit where they were driving a convertible and pressed a button on the dash and hot tea came out of the tap. They drank it from actual cups and saucers while going down the road. When the credits started rolling, I realized that Voldemort had been in it...Ralph Fiennes as John Steed. Sean Connery was also in it. I do like his voice.","1372":"I love this movie it is so funny and I wanted to get it so my kids could enjoy it as well. they liked it too, its great when a show is funny enough and timeless enough to engage all the family no matter the age and gender. we love to sit around and watch movies together and this is a great addition to our collection.","1373":"Excellent experience.","1375":"Video quality is not a good as the first four seasons, but is outweighed by FINALLY having the entire series here at home.","1376":"Great show love having the whole series great condition.","1377":"still is funny after all these years.","1378":"Bob Newhart one of the best!","1381":"The product was as advertised, delivered quickly and fairly priced.  What's not to like?","1386":"I bought this movie in the $3 bin at a local discount store. I then read the reviews and thought I had been had. However, I actually liked this movie. Sean Connery as the bad guy and I found it very well done with excellent picture quality.","1389":"Funny, love his humor","1390":"Dry humor is an acquired taste, and if you're a fan of that kind of humor and a fan of Newhart, this is for you. Great banter among the characters, good Chicago references (there weren't many TV shows set in Chicago at that time) and situations that have held up surprisingly well over time make this an underrated show worth taking a look at. Too bad this show didn't last longer, but the cast and producers decided to go out while on top rather than wear out their welcome.","1391":"Finally got to see the ending of a wonderful series, as I missed it when it was on the air.  What a wonderful show.","1392":"Terrific final season of a great TV comedy.","1393":"Glad to finally have this show","1394":"It arrived just as promised!  I love this show!","1395":"Great comedy, great cast, fast shipping by Amazon, everything good. So glad all the seasons of this very warm and funny comedy are finally available. No extras on this DVD, but that's OK. Now I'm waiting for them to release the rest of the Newhart series. Hope it's soon.","1396":"Great classic sitcom finally on DVD!  Loved every episode!","1397":"This completes the series , 1st rate","1398":"This collection is the best of Newhart. They just don't make TV like this anymore. Too bad. Wewould rather watch these than anything on TV today. Always a great laugh.","1400":"Excellent series.  I'm watching it now, and it brings back so many memories.  I've even gotten my son to watch some of the episodes, and I catch him laughing though I think he didn't expect to find this funny.  Bob Newhart is a comic genius.  I would recommend this seller.","1407":"Get-A-Way is rather silly and dated(even for 1968) and Wish You Were Here is just silly AND annoying. Other than that, I liked the rest of the episodes just fine, even the compilation Homicide and Old Lace, which had to use several season 5 scenes to pad everything out. Strange, but interesting.","1408":"Big Fan","1409":"the dvd's are in perfect shape, I'm very pleased","1410":"Love the show and to have all seasons and extras in one set is fantastic.","1413":"With this cast and the source to work from this should have been great , but alas the shot themselves in the foot with this bomb. Next to \"Wild,Wild, West\" as the worst T.V. show to movie ever made!!!!!!!!","1415":"No one was clamoring for a big-screen remake of the classic \"Avengers\" TV series, but Hollywood didn't listen and churned out this forgettable box-office fiasco. Despite its impressive visual style, the finished product made a good cast look terribly foolish. Ironically, the film's most positive aspect was introducing new viewers to the original exploits of John Steed and Emma Peel.","1416":"Haven' ben able to review these yet, but looking forward to it with an older TV series","1417":"WOW!","1419":"Excellent series. Just as I remembered the dry-witted Bob Newhart. Bill Daly is a riot, also.","1426":"In the hit or miss business called \"show\" and the utter lack of ideas that are being pitched to movie studios lately it was only a matter of time till \"they\" got their \"greedy little hands\" on a terrific classic TV show \"The Avengers\" John Steed and Emma Peel, clever scripts, plus the unrequited sexual tension between the two characters, a gem.  Ralph Finnes is so blah I wonder why he's a movie star at all.","1427":"I was browsing....and guess what I found!!!!  Season 5 and Season 6 are being released 02\/15!!!!!  They are here at Amazon for preorder, and at Shoutfactory.\n\nAlready in my wishlist.  I am SO glad they are being released.  i didn't want to shell out $$$ for the complete series since I own Seasons 1-4.\n\nHurry up Februrary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","1428":"The problem is that I have been waiting for ever to get the last two season of the Bob Newhart Show. I already had seasons 1 through 4, but to get the last two seasons you have to buy the entire package. That is really a smarmy way of making the customer pay more money.","1429":"Great series but I could not find the episodes with commentary so I contacted Shout. they told me seasons 3 & 4 have certain episodes\nwith commentary also look closely on season 4 for extra bonus features Thank You!!","1430":"Really nice presentation of a superb show.  Good sound and picture.","1431":"Item arrived timely and was as described.  Thank you very much.","1436":"WARNING:  Even though the packaging says it includes 6 trailers, There is only one.  Appearantly the other five trailers are included on a CD which is no longer part of the latest DVD release.\nI loved this movie.  The photography is crisp and beautiful.  And there are some Uma Kill Bill action.  If you are an Uma Kill Bill fan, you'll enjoy this movie much more than what the critics are saying.","1437":"I never saw the orginal Avengers series, but judging by the reviews, I think I ought to.  I love Uma Thurman and Ralph Fiennes which is why I bought the movie, and they did a heck of job styling up their characters in post-60s mod.  But The plot was completely crap and disjointed.  Someone on the editting floor was not paying attention to what they were doing.\n\nNonetheless, entertaining enough to pass a boring day.","1438":"As glimpsed by director-interviewer Matthew Diamond, Paul Taylor is at once a brutal task-master, insecure about his work, and overall, a somewhat remote human being, owing to a solitary early life in foster care. But a pure love of the dance is the unifying, invigorating force for him and his company, and we are the beneficiaries in this candid, behind-the-scenes look at a bona fide artistic institution.","1441":"If Amazon had a higher star I give it 10 stars. Get IT","1442":"I love Bob Newhart.  I have waited a LONG LONG time for seasons 5-6.  I watched him in prime time in the 70's. I wish they would have released it so you could just get seasons 5-6 and not the whole thing but that is ok with me . I am just glad 5-6 are now available. yay!","1450":"Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1966, I was in the 6th grade and discovered Steed and Emma on TV, and I adored them. So when this film was released, I never expected it to \"live up to\" the originals. But I was surprised at how faithful it was to the tone and wackiness of the old series. I may be in the minority in thinking this, but I believe \"The Avengers\" was brought lovingly to the screen. And although it ain't the \"real thing,\" it deserves kudos for being a noble, and even entertaining, effort.","1457":"One of the worst movies ever made. Watching Sean Connery in a bear suit while running around was ugly. The pair (Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman) have no chemistry what so ever and talk like their English. Horrible. He fights people with an umbrella and she can't fight at all. Mechanical bees chase their car and it was so exciting! Not! I hated this movie and Sean Connery lost any respect that I had for him. Don't ever drink tea again and eat your muffins somewhere else!","1458":"i give this film two stars because although you have to question why three good actors such as these would even consider this script, they still acted well with the poor amount they got. but still, how could great actors such as these three accept such a terrible script? what were they thinking?","1460":"I already own seasons 1 thru 4, so I'm very disappointed not to be able to purchase 5 and 6 separately. The price of the complete set is a bit high when I only need two seasons. Not sure what to do, but I'm hoping the price will go down, or they will also release 5 and 6 at a later date. I do like the Bob Newhart Show, it was always a favorite.","1462":"Who is funnier then the great Bob Newhart. It's about time. Great show with lots of laughs. And the price is right. We have been waiting for years. So Glad someone is finally listening to the consumer again. And now we are finally getting Bob's second long running show NEWHART. It's about time. Can't wait for the mail to arrive.","1463":"Awesome to have the complete series available. No idea why the previous issue did not finish the series. I will have to sell that one some day.","1464":"Am slowly going through the entire series and realizing Bob Newhart and everyone on the show are so fantastically funny--even after all these years.","1465":"1of my favorite shows","1466":"This is such a great series. I've been watching it every night since I purchased it. I had the earlier double disc collection which I hated. Gave  them away and thanks so much to Shout Factory I'm enjoying this complete collection of THE BOB NEWHART SHOW. Plus comes with bonus features. No disappointment here.","1467":"from a succesfull TV-Series and with actors like Connery, Thurman and Fiennes, they come out with this??? The Script is bad, but the editing even worse. There's nothing going for this movie, even the acting looked bad, the Director didn't have a clue of what he was doing. Don't watch this movie even if you have time to waste, is just not worth it.","1471":"I like it. Everyone here is charming.","1472":"This show is hilarious, they do not do comedy like this anymore.","1473":"I grew up watching this series in its original run in the 1970s.  So glad to have all six seasons together.  Really evokes so many fond memories for me as I re-watch these classic sitcom shows from my youth.  I highly recommend this set for fans of The Bob Newhart Show.  No DVD set is perfect, but the negative reviews are overblown here in my opinion.  This is a fun set and I have no regrets after buying it.","1474":"They could've done a lot more in the name of consistency among the episodes video quality and color saturation. Some are a little pale, some over saturated, some darker than others. But it's better than nothing. At least it's not abridged like the odd couple discs. I'm still fuming over that","1479":"Totally understand the people who hoped the last seasons would be released separately; many personal budgets are tight.\nBut after so long, it really was time for the complete series to be available no matter how it was issued.\nThis is a funny, well-written show, and I'm ecstatic to have every episode, even with minor edits.\nLove ya Bob and Co., and thanks Shout Factory!","1480":"very nice funny to watch. glad to have got the series","1481":"Shout hasn't released Rhoda season 5 so I have no hopes of them doing the right thing and releasing Bob's seasons 5 & 6.\nCapitalism. The only way to make them do right is through consequence. By not purchasing their products.","1482":"If you are a Bob Newhart fan you will love this! I know most of us didn't get to view each episode of the series, ... so here is your chance! Great set and the price was right!","1488":"Why does Hollywood waste its budget on movies based on 50's, 60's, or 70's TV shows?  Can't anybody think for themselves anymore?  Films like these give good actors bad reputations, and Ralph Fiennes, Sean Connery, and Uma  Thurman are great actors.  The three of them must've been trying to hang  themselves after the theater release.","1489":"I loved the Bob Newhart Show and had heard that a boxed set of the entire six seasons was out.  The price from Amazon was the lowest one I found.  Fast delivery too.","1490":"I think this is one of the best sitcoms of the '70s.  The cast of characters were all excellent in their roles and the humor was not like the juvenile crap that passes for humor now on television.  When I saw it was being released on video I pounced because I think this was Newhart at his best.  His show as the innkeeper had some funny moments, but not the wit of this show.","1491":"Three cheers for the Shout Factory for giving us this great set, after 20th Century Fox refused to release the last two seasons. This is beautifully packaged and far superior to the product 20th Century Fox gave us for Seasons 1-4.","1494":"Tiresome, absurd, and senseless plot, but the kiddies might enjoy it for the special effects and cartoon like action sequences.  I wish I could say it was the worst movie I've seen in awhile, but the Mod Squad has that  honor.  A total disgrace to the original TV series.","1495":"As a fan of the original Avengers t.v. series I have to say that I was so excited when this movie was previewed with what I thought would be an outstanding cast that I can hardly contain my displeasure at how  predictable, boring and stupid this film was.  Although the performances  were credible the story was so bad that I wish I could get the price of  admission back.\nSave your money.  Trust me!","1496":"I already own seasons 1 - 4 and like many others have been waiting for 5 & 6. I can continue living a happy life without buying the complete set of 6 seasons. Feels like extortion to me. I am not going to buy it this way!!!!","1498":"I've been weary of something like this happening. Roseanne and Cosby were released in their chopped up syndicated versions instead of the original... which version are these?\nAlso...\nIt's really great that this series finally came out completely... but what about those of us who YEARS AGO  bought seasons 1-4... waited patiently for the rest... and want the rest of it? Do we just chuck out DVDs we paid as much as $49.95 a piece just to get the last seasons?","1500":"I've already purchased seasons 1 through 4 as many other people also have. Now I'm informed that I cannot buy seasons 5 and 6 separately! That means I have to spend $80 which amounts to $40 per season to get the last 2 and get stuck with the first 4 seasons again.\n\nWell I guess that means I won't have seasons 5 and 6!","1502":"I knew I had to see it as I am a fan of the TV series.  It's almost as if the writers watched a few old episodes, picked up a few ideas and threw them into the script.  Absolutely NOTHING worked, the daft things Steed did (like the tea making  in the car) worked in the TV show because it was done with style; in the  film it came over as  pathetic.  Uma Thurman is no Diana Rigg; she can't  act and was totally inept.","1503":"Always liked the Tara King episodes.","1504":"Love the original Avengers series, watched them all as a kid in black and white.","1505":"all was good to see","1506":"OK","1507":"I love the vintage Avengers.  This set of episodes is exciting and contains some that I have not seen before.  I recommend these editions of the Avengers to anyone who appreciates the show as it appeared back in 1967.","1508":"I have to second everyone else's emotion.  This is unfair that we have to buy a whole box set to gets seasons 5 and 6 when most of us already bought 1 - 4.  I am very disappointed.  I have been diligently waiting for a long time for the rest of the series.","1509":"Box set won't be out for another month or so, but I'll go out on a limb, and predict greatness.\n\nHope they cleaned up the transfers. The original releases of the first 4 seasons were pretty poor.\n\nThere's nobody like Newhart. Watch and see.\n\nADDED: To the various dissenters (crybabies) who think they have to buy Seasons 1-4 again, Shout plans on selling Seasons 5 and 6 separately. So, be patient, and stop whining.","1512":"Shout is an amazing company that gives old TV series a real boost in cleaning up the picture and audio. I have the Fox releases and I hated the audio. I will gladly double dip for those four seasons and the two remaining seasons. Thanks Shout!\n\n***Update June 3, 2014***\n\nPicture and audio quality - no different from the FOX releases. That's sad. I am mixed on this set and am changing my five star review to a three star.","1513":"As of the date of this posting, Shout Factory's website has the complete set for 99.99, AND you get the set a full month before street date (you get it on 04\/22\/14). I still give the set 5 stars here though, because the show was amazing and it sounds as though the extras for the set are great.","1514":"Too bad the Avengers series are no longer being made. Netflix use to stream it but no more. If Amazon could snag the series I might reconsider Prime. I use to watch this as a little girl and it brought back a lot of fond memories","1515":"Like the Avengers and Mrs. Peel....\nEnglish humor,,, price reasonable ....\nstill interesting stories and colorful characters\nprice is affordable and play well","1516":"Representing the Early Black and White Episodes, you cant go wrong for vintage sexy retro British Spy T.V.!  \"Mrs. Peel\" and John Steed are ever the sleek, elegant crime fighters from a different age.  And theres always champagne at the end...Cheers!","1517":"The Avengers was a classic television series. It had intelligence, wit, great characters, good plots - if sometimes they did stretch credibility -  and the incredible chemistry between Patrick Macnee and Diana Rigg. The shows here are not, in my opinion, the best of the series but even the second best are top grade. Rigg is as beautiful and charming as I remembered her and no actor has portrayed an English gentleman better than Macnee.","1520":"Thank's for the outstanding job in keeping and sending this video in perfect shape . I will enjoy it for manny years to come. ART","1522":"It was a good show.  I did, however think I had ordered the Newhart Christmas...but this program was okay too.\nEnjoyed it.","1525":"This is a very good and very funny tv show. Unfortunatelly  I haven't seen a lot of the episodes for several years so I snatched this up. Ill  be  watching a lot of  theese  when  it arrives. One of my favorite episodes was when Bob Howard and Jerry got drunk on Thanksgiving and tried to order Chinese food. Between those three and Emily Carol and Bobs patients it was a very funny show which is finally getting released in its entirety. You should get it.","1526":"I took heat from someone oin  Amazon. COM for statements I made about an upcoming release from this series. Now, finally comes a proper release from Shout Factory. I will be buying this set for my collection.","1531":"They are clearly gouging by not offering the final 2 seasons separately. There is NO excuse not to. It's no secret people are hungry for the final 2 seasons, we have been waiting for 6-7 years and it's clearly documented. They are just taking advantage.","1532":"I watched the Bob Newhart Show when I was younger so when I saw The Very Best of the Bob Newhart in this boxed set I just had to get it. I was well pleased with my purchase.","1533":"I'm holding out hope that Amazon might release the two final seasons in download form which never came out in the DVD sets.  If they do, I'll pick them up for sure.  We'd sure like to complete our collection.  This may allow us an opportunity to do just that!  (Same with the final three seasons of Mary Tyler Moore.)","1534":"The Bob Newhart Show remains my favorite show of all time.  It is witty, funny, and timeless.  This is a wonderful ensemble show, with great comedic acting from the stars down to the walk-on characters.  I have waited for years to see this show come out on DVD.  I can't understand why it still has not been released in that format.","1536":"In the bold tradition of The Avengers, this movie tends to wind it's way around and about several story lines and a dozen characters.  If you've ever seen an episode and liked it, you will LOVE this modern re-telling!  Not for movie critics or whiny  why-doesn't-every-little-thing-make-sense'ers. . .  Not stop action and  wit!","1537":"again I cant say enough about it is very action packed and it was a great way for back in the times","1538":"Steed and Emma Peel.  Who could ask for more.  The elaborate and twisted plots as always are foiled by the debonaire Stted and always beatufil Emma Peel.  Wathced this as a child.  Enjoyed watching the episodes again.  A definate addition to my library.","1539":"Set is in fairly good condition. It skips through two episodes on one disk. I will try to clean and fill the disc and\nI expect it to work fine. It was said to play well and I do not consider that to be playing well.","1540":"Mrs. Peel elevates all scenes she is in to the edge by not knowing what to expect from her role as a mystery solving investigator while working hand in hand with Steed. Excellent program writing which is what we have come to expect from the Brits.","1541":"I can't get enough of Steed and Mrs. Peel. This was a great purchase and I'm thrilled to add it to my growing collection of The Avengers.","1542":"I really enjoyed the first and third episodes.  The middle episode looked too corny right from the start, so I skipped it. A mixed bag, but consider it if you can get it at a decent price.  I don't know why Avengers DVDs are so expensive!","1543":"I remember these as a child.  I loved them then, and I love them now.  Although they may seem a little campy now, the interaction of Emma Peele and Patrick McGee is as delightful as ever.","1544":"I have watched The Avengers since it ran in the 60s.  I've also recorded as many Avengers episodes from A&E and other sites on VHS as I can.  This disc set is great!  Even though I have watched this series for years, there were at least 2-3 episodes I don't remember ever seeing PLUS the rest of the disc set are classics.  This set is a must buy for Emma Peel fans, her first year, and Avengers fans.","1545":"There is not much to say about the color series of The Avengers, with Emma Peal.  It is, quite simply, among the most entertaining and clever television ever produced anywhere.\n\nIs it the scripts, or is Diana Rigg's caustic and dry delivery just brilliant -- or both?\n\nNever mind, just sit back, enjoy the wonderful colors of the sets and outfits, and get ready to have fun.\n\nBTW, the transfers are beautiful.  They did it right on this one.","1546":"The product was as advertised.  Delivery was very quick.  The price was fair.  I'm totally happy with this transaction.","1547":"Product exactly as advertised.  Fair price.  Quick delivery.  What's not to like.  I'll be back!","1548":"It would not be possible to be more pleased than I am.  The product appears to be brand new even though it was sold as \"used\".  Delivery was fast, the price fair.  There's nothing to add except that I have already placed another order with this same supplier which should speak volumes.  As a certain actor once said:  \"I'll be back!\"","1549":"This show should never have gone out of reruns. The DVD arrived on time and in good condition.","1550":"A number of actors have played the part but I like these 2 actors best of all.","1551":"A very enjoyable movie. I have watched this movie on public access TV and when I discovered it on DVD I went ahead and got it again and watched it. Now that it is in my library of DVDs. I can pull it down and watch it any time I want to.","1552":"One of the best versions of Jane Eyre .... Ciarn Hinds is wonderful as Rochester and Samantha Morton is a perfect Jane.","1553":"Another great Film...","1555":"good","1556":"The DVD had a small crack in it, and would not play.","1557":"I have read this book before and it is interesting to see it in a movie form.","1559":"This is a very enjoyable  old TV classic.  So my review will only deal with the video quality.  And that is a very well done re-master of the old film.  The quality does not match current DVD offerings, but I was impressed how well they restored the old videos; I don't know how they could have done better.  Therefore I am giving this a rating of 5.","1566":"A great series.  Emma Peel (Diana Rigg) was and still is the sexiest of the female martial arts heroes before or since.  Patrick McNee was in real life not too dissimilar from character John Steed but he never matched his work in this series.  Low key, tongue-in-cheek funny, pretty non-violent, and still remembered and revered today, it should be a model for TV and movies today in lieu of the pseudo-scientific, over-the-top special effects stuff we get instead.","1568":"I love most all Jane Eyre movies, this one is GREAT !!!!","1569":"So far, My Favorite Production of a well-told Story.","1570":"MY FAVORITE EDITION OF JANE EYRE.  I LOVE CIARAN HINDS.  ALL THE ACTORS ARE WONDERFUL.  VERY WELL DONE.","1571":"Excellent version of Jane Eyre.  There is obviously some gaps, due to time constraints, but the movie is well done.  Cieran Hinds is brilliant!","1572":"the best of all 10 Jane Eyre ever made","1573":"These are some of the best shows I've seen. I'm a big \"Avengers\" fan and have episodes back to the Honor Blackman days. No doubt that Mrs. Peel and Steed were the best duo to tdo the show. I recommend their episodes to anybody.","1578":"Love it'm","1579":"good version","1580":"I rented and watched all the Jane Eyre movies to see which one I liked best.  I believe they are all good and you really can't go wrong but this is my favorite.  Highly recommend if you like Jane Eyre.","1581":"Love this version over all the others!","1582":"Love it and have every  version I can find.","1588":"John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. They look good, very good. If you relish a series like \"The Avengers\" or \"Twilight Zone\" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of what you are getting. Like Emma might say to John, \"Can I borrow your umbrella just one more time? Thank You Mother.","1590":"everything was great","1591":"This DVD would not play on my machine even though it's designed for Blu-Ray DVDs.  Additional the only subtitles were in Spanish.  I had to return it.","1592":"Charlotte Bronte is second only to Jane Austen as the best author ever.  this is an excellent classic and very well done.  However, even though Jane Eyre obviously had never been kissed prior to falling in love with Mr. Rochester, her director in this movie should have told her to fake it because the lack of experience in the kiss does not endear one to the scene.  And it was a very critical scene but I wanted to throw rocks at her.  The movie is excellent and well done....other than the kissing scene.","1593":"Hands down - Samatha Mortion is the best Jane Eyre ever!","1594":"nice","1595":"Not my favorite Jane Eyre version...Mr. Rochester was a bit too rough for the character. Samantha Morton did superbly!","1597":"This movie is good, but entirely too rushed. It would have been a very good idea, in my opinion, it have at least put captions letting you know how many years passed between particular scenes. With it not being this way you miss much of the power of her story. However, no screen adaption is ever perfect, and given that decades of Jane's life are covered in an hour and a half (thus the benefit of captions) the movie adaption is about as faithful as you can do.","1598":"I usually don't like remakes of old movies, but this one is great.  The character of Jane is a strong woman.  Not in today's sense where \"strong\" women can be obnoxious and demanding or for that matter can beat any guy in the room, but in the truest sense.  Jane overcomes a terrible childhood to become a governess.  Even though she falls in love with the master of house she is able to control her emotions and conduct herself with dignity.  It's a beautiful love story and well worth watching.","1599":"the story is great the acting was terrific","1600":"I am happy with my purchase. I would buy from seller again.","1601":"Good movie.","1602":"Best Jane Eyre movie ever! I like this version the best! Much more of the book to it. The acting is superb!","1604":"I love Jane Eyre and I have tried to watch every version there is to see how close to the book they are.  Cirian Hinds and Samatha Morton are favorite actors as well.  However, I thought this production of Jane Eyre was lacking.","1605":"In my opinion, the best! of all the Jane Eyre movies! Love it!!!!","1606":"I bought this movie to add to my Jane Eyre movies.  It is well acted and most enjoyable.  This is how I introduce my granddaughter to classics.","1607":"Samantha Morton and Ciarn Hinds work so well together in classic story, great actors, have intensity, enough darkness, enough moodiness to make for intriguing interpretation, the order arrived in good condition and timely.","1608":"Each version has plusses and minuses and are priceless because of the artful interpretations and choice of actors.  Much pleasure received when watching.  I especially l love watching Ciaran Hinds.","1610":"Who can forget Ciran Hinds as Edward Rochester?! Love this adaption of Charlotte Bronte's novel! The supporting cast is splendid as well!","1611":"I like Samantha Morton as Jane Eyre she portrays Jane as the solom young lady that she was in the book. Not expecting much from the world but determined to make out there. I was not real crazy about Edward Rochester he seemed to be a little to harsh from the character in the book","1612":"I thought this would be the movie that didn't cut out some much of the book when Jane leaves Mr. Rochester. It barely shows the time she spent away from him and her growth as a woman.  I might try the BBC version because it looks longer and might actually include more from the book.","1613":"This has been done so many times, but this is a good version of the story and Ciaran Hinds plays his part quite well. It has an interesting story line from beginning to end.","1614":"This version is the 3rd that I have found to have fallen short of the mark.  This one is more likeable of the 3, but still not the best.\n\n  Ciaran Hinds does his best, but it's his delivery.  Any way, it's not one that I want to add to my Jane Eyre collection.\n\n  I can, however, recommend the Timothy Dalton 1983 Version as well as the Toby Stevens 2006 Version. They are fabulous!","1615":"I love my movie collection 97% was bought from amazon I will continue to collect and I do from this sight and all movies were in excellent condition whether bought pre-owned or brand new not once did I receive a broke or scratched movie . Just make sure you read about the seller that they have good scores and reviews.","1616":"They finally got two interesting actors for the lead roles in this movie adoption - I enjoyed watching it - they really played their parts well.","1617":"Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are in one of the most romantic love stories I have ever seen on film.","1618":"I must have read the book hundreds of times in my youth. This is my favorite Jane Eyre movie. The movie was wonderful.","1619":"He is one of the best Mr Rochester's ever\nI am glad that I added it to my collection of\nJane Eyre movies","1620":"I love the different versions of this story its just depend of your liking Cerion Hinds and Samantha Morton  Verses the other other 3 versions  know of .. this was a great version of this pair actors","1621":"probably one of the best jane eyre ever,,,you will love it - well done, great for a family gathering or a peaceful evening together... the acting is well done, the story is well done - you like jane eyre...you will love this one","1622":"This is my favorite version of \"Jane Eyre.\"  Believable, lifelike characters, and good acting.  Keeps one's interest throughout.  I highly recommend this film.","1623":"I didn't think any remake of \"Jane Eyre\" could possibly be better than the version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.  This one is right up there.  I've watched it often, and I'm pleased that I could finally own a copy.  If you like the Bronte's books, I highly recommend this movie.","1625":"Samantha Morton won my heart in this absolutely amazing movie. I ended up purchasing every movie she made after seeing her in this. She's a really Great actress and I'm sure most anyone would enjoy this movie.","1630":"I saw this version as a girl. It has been a favorite.\nprobably always will be. I have see just about every version out there.","1636":"This is my favorite Jane Erye adaptation of all, due to excellent acting. Although less true to the book than some others, this Jane Erye offers such good characterizations that one can't but root for both stars, as well as get caught up in the romantic tensions. I loved it.","1637":"This is a loose version, some things were added that were not in the book, much was left out.  but a book such as this would have to be a mini-series to remain true.  That being said, I like this version.  Ciran Hinds never disappoints, and is so handsome.  Yes he's stiff in the movie, but so was Edward in the book.  I like it, and will probably buy this version, maybe.  still a couple more versions to see before I select one for my personal library.","1638":"I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately. Having seen part of it on TV, my initial feelings were confirmed. This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester; as I always pictured him, dark, loud, brash, demanding, but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation. Mr. Hinds's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen's \"Persuasion\", starring him, and I find it excellent as well.","1639":"good series","1640":"A real masterpiece of a miniseries, covering the lives and loves of the aristocratic Bellamy family and their servants from 1903-1930. Also includes behind the scenes footage, the 40th anniversary special with interviews, and the spinoff series Thomas and Sarah.","1641":"I love this series","1642":"Hard to understand at times.  Not on par with Downton Abby.","1643":"this show was the talk of the town  when it fist aired.  It will always be a classic.","1644":"This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face.","1648":"If you are a devoted Jane Erye fan you may not like this movie .If you like a romantic movie then you will enjoy this  one I really thought hinds was the Rochester that Bronte was writing about personaley I did like this movie .","1650":"lovely well observed and written unforgettable characters","1651":"Great show if you like early 20th century life in London","1652":"love this whole series. If you loved Downton Abbey you will love this series too.","1660":"good","1661":"Promptly delivered in good condition.  Tells a very charming story from two points of view.  Love it.","1662":"Some are in Black and White and some in color. It often stalls. I guess the DVD version has some compatibility problems. The sitcom itself is SLOW. I do think I would have enjoyed it - not in a memorable way - but for the day if there hadn't been so many technology problems. I should have and may still send them back as they are basically unviewable unless you have the patience of Job.","1666":"I thoroughly enjoyed this version of one of my favourite novels. Both of the main actors gave credible and passionate performances to their characters.","1667":"Fast service. .had never seen this series\"back in the day\" and thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thanks!","1668":"yes","1669":"This movie and cast was well chosen. Mr Rochester (Hinds) Is a not too handsome of a  man ( but I think so), that is a stern and rugged hell of a man. When Jane comes, she is soft and not aware of what a man really is. The two give  \"performances of a lifetime\". I would have to die first before I would let this movie go. Shows what love is supposed to be. \"Inner love\".","1670":"This is by far the best Jane Eyre out there at this time...the performances are brilliant, the original text respected...the character of Rochester is for once done as it was meant to be done.  I highly recommend, if you like your movies to show some respect for the books they represent.","1672":"I HAVE SEEN ALL THE JANE EYRE ADAPTATIONS....THESE TWO MAIN CHARACTERS WERE GREAT TOGETHER..I LOVE CIARAN HINDS ..HE DOES LIKE ALWAYS AN EXCELLENT JOB WITH HIS CHARACTERS..AND AS FOR SAMAMTHA MORGAN..SHE COMPLETED THIS ROLE TO PERFECTION..I THINK THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES..DO NOT ALLOW THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS TO PREVENT THE VIEWING OF THIS CLASSIC MASTERPIECE.","1689":"The quality of the DVD is excellent.","1690":"loved it.  Missed it the first time around, and was hobbled by a bad hip.  the early scenes are akin to the \"honeymooners\" in graphics, but the series develops nicely and is addicting.","1691":"Wonderful!!  I haven't seen it all but very good stuff.","1692":"My wife and watched this around the time we got married, it's nice to have it around again. Price was pretty good at the time we bought it (May 2015)","1693":"With two such fine performers as Ciaran Hinds and Samantha Morton, and with Charlotte Bronte's masterful story, I could not believe that this version of Jane Eyre would be anything but enjoyable.  Sadly, I was disappointed.  I think the problem lies with the screenplay. A complex story was reduced to 2 hours, which meant that key plot and character development had to be sacrificed.  Hinds and Morton just did not have enough to work with.  Stick with the Timothy Dalton version, it is far better.","1694":"Wonderful. I loved the book since I was a child and when i saw version of Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, I didn't think anything could top that. However, this one is fabulous as well. Ciaran Hinds is perfect as Mr. Rochester. After seeing this movie I became a big fan of his. If you like good love stories this is a must see.","1696":"Great","1697":"What can I say, this show is not only deep and well acted, but it really captures the change in social order before and after WWI.","1698":"My wife and I fully enjoyed the series. Sent promptly as well.","1699":"Absolutely love this series.  Planning on taking a day and watching on the DVD's in a Upstairs\/Downstairs marathon.","1700":"great series","1703":"Arrived on time as always. Nice package DVD's are each in plastic flip folders. Great old BBC drama show(as stated in other reviews it is a poor mans Downton Abbey)but still excellent show for the day.","1704":"great series...love the era that it takes place in!! great actors !!","1705":"This is a wonderful series and I hated to see it end!  Really gives a historical view of what early English high society was like with their hired help.  You really become attached to the characters.  Enjoy!","1710":"great","1711":"Great DVD.  Excellent product, shipping, and packaging.","1712":"Got a little bored with it","1713":"When I finally caught up with this set, I was rather late to the party, I guess.\nA well-known retailer had packaged only 3 discs and sold them as a complete\nversion. Beware.  It can be difficult to find a \"Fourth Season\" available as a\nsingle purchase.","1714":"Love, love, love this series","1715":"nce buy","1716":"I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions.  The \"Jane\" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive.  How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her?  When they kiss in the movie there is the \"chemistry\" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about.  All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition.  This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book.","1718":"Wonderful series..I became part of the family both upstairs and downstairs..I am so in love with all these British series.","1719":"This Batch of British Treacle was Especially Strange as I'D seen Many Other English Sagas prior. As I came to it at LAST ,Rather than First , I knew it desired from me a LOT of Apt Attention. I , Naturally, Gave it That. And became Addicted in process. Yummy AND Soapy , enjoy in as small or LARGE of doses as possible. BUT ENJOY!!!!!","1720":"very good","1721":"I read this book long before I saw the movie and I definitely say that it lived up to my expectations.  Jane Eyre is a timeless story and it is beautifully captured in this gothic tale of romance and hidden secrets.  Each character is portrayed very well.  Samantha Morton (who plays Jane Eyre), actually became her seemingly meek and yet truly passionate character before my very eyes.  I would recommend this film to anyone who loved the book, as well as anyone who loves romance and a bit of mystery.","1723":"good buy","1724":"Excellent, just as wonderful as I remember from when I was a teen. Love having this. Great viewing for a rainy night!","1725":"Loved this series. So glad I bought it. I have watched it many times. Loved it","1726":"fun seeing this again","1730":"To this day, Monty Python remains THE idol and source of inspiration to humourists all around. Monty Python's Flying Circus made the group famous, and it is the best ever to come out, not only from Monty Python, not only from Britain... but humour in general!\nHighlights on this tape: The Ministry Of Silly Walks, The Spanish Inquisition, Flying Lessons\/Hijacked Plane (To Luton), 'The Bishop', Accidents Sketch and Registry Office.\nOwn it!","1732":"I disagree with the viewer from Cambrige Ontario. I found this version lovely! Samantha Morton was excellent (I need to see \"Emma\" now), reserved, thoughtful, just as Jane was in the book. Jane had high emotions  but did not strike out often...the childhood was a small part of the book,  and though important, it is not the major part of the story. The  relationship with Bessie and Helen and Mrs Reed are important as well. I  found this version to be just fine, and I am going to buy it!","1733":"Will always enjoy watching  Upstairs\/Downstairs.  So well done in every way.  Favorite actor, Jean Marsh, also Lesley Anne Down.","1734":"Classic TV Show. Would use seller for other DVD's.","1735":"A classic, need I say more","1736":"Half way through these","1737":"Loved it when it came out all those years ago - love it still.  This series retains its cachet.....If you love Downton Abbey, you should try this series as well!  Look for some actors who have gone on to other memorable performances.....","1738":"rather disappointing after Mr S\nacting and characters great\nsets and clothing pathetic","1739":"A bit of a slow starter.  The characters were great.  I enjoyed the story line.","1740":"Didn't know sever series are in black & white. I  felt it was to drab, and very boring. just not my cup of tea!","1741":"I can't even get past the first volume, it's pathetic, I wouldn't recommend to anyone who didn't want to fall asleep from pure boredom.  Some were black and  white due to a strike when it was made and it's just a chopped up mess.  Wasted my money on this one.","1742":"I missed this on public TV and and very happy that we have the opportunity to purchase the long running show on a DVD.\nExcellent story line and excellent acting. I know you will be glued to the TV to watch each episode.","1743":"I have heard of this series for years, but never had the chance to see it. So when i clicked on amazon  and saw the price it was (to me) a bargain!\nWriting and acting are great. It really gives the sense of that period in history. If you like Downton Abby, you will like this. Definitely recommend this series.","1745":"I'm not through with the complete series, but am into the end of the 3rd season and am enjoying it. I must admit that I have a problem with the accents of a few of the characters, but the plots are masterful and I see why it was an award winner.","1746":"I remember well when this series was broadcast in the 1970's\/.It's a delightful series and very similar to Downton Abbey, or I should say, DA is quite similar to Upstairs, Downstairs. Being of English ancestry, I discovered more of the British personality and liked what I saw and experienced.","1747":"What to say, a classic, the best of British television. It looks like Downton Abbey may be a close rival but upstairs downstairs is the epitome of good theater.","1748":"I missed the series when it aired. The writing is terrific, and so is the acting. Several episodes have left me stunned -- in a good way. If you like Downton Abbey and are sorry their are so few episodes,go back and look at this series. It's the parent of the other one.","1749":"I remember looking forward to watching this miniseries just as I do Downton Abbey.\nBut I was disappointed because the quality of production and filming is not up to today's standard.","1750":"I was expecting this to be wonderful from the reviews, but due to the wretched moral values of many of the Upstairs people I had a hard time enjoying the story.  A few of the Downstairs people had difficulties, too, but they in general set better standards of conduct.  Wish I could sell my copy.","1751":"It really does. OK, it was filmed forty years ago, so the odd wobbly wall etc, but if you don't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human.","1753":"If you like downtown abby you'll like this series too. You'll want to own the complete set so as to keep up with its soap opera like show. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do.","1755":"Sold it on eBay for half the price after only watching 15. Minutes. Would recommend you only purchase one DVD before you buy the whole set. I had thought it would be like Downton  Abbey unfortunately it was not even close.","1756":"We wondered what all the fuss was about. A forty year old series?! The quaint black and white pictures and simplistic sets in the first episodes recede from your consciousness as the stories draw you in. Before long, you have a vested interest in the lives of these people and the history they are living becomes vivid - and feels current. We missed them when we finished viewing and will watch it again.","1757":"The beginning of this series starts off very slowly. It felt like watching a high school play.\nThat is unfortunate because viewers probably lose interest.  Please stay with it; it gets so\nmuch better! I loved this series.","1759":"Loved this one and the original as well. So different - yet the same in many ways. The characters are quite interesting. It is also fun to see the characters in other parts - other movies -","1760":"I am enjoying each and every one of the stories in this series.  Perhaps I'm the only person alive who never saw them before, but I'm thoroughly entertained by this well-made series.","1762":"I expected more or maybe I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.  Was enjoyable, but was somewhat disappointed.  I'll watch it...only once.","1763":"I loved the original series and wanted to add it to my DVD collection.  Finally got a terrific price buying on Amazon.  Was purchased \"used\" for a very reasonable price and was in condition like new.  Looking forward to many enjoyable hours\nwatching this classic British series.","1764":"I had never seen this series when it was on tv.  I had heard such good things about it so I figured I'd see what it was all about.  At first I had a bit of a time getting into it, BUT...once I did...I was hooked.  It's a great series.","1765":"We should not compare Upstairs Downstairs with Dawnton Abby, but enjoy both of them. I remember seeing Upstairs Downstairs 40 years ago, and it was absolutely great acting and the storyline captivating. The way movies are made now are of course changed, but that should not keep us seeing the ones made 40 or more years ago. I will recommend this DVD and go back in time.","1766":"I am almost at the end of it and I don't want it to end!\nThe characters are great, the plot is superb, the production is unbelievable, specially if you take into account that it was made so many years ago.","1767":"Video is fine, but understanding British speech, although it is lovely, is nearly impossible with this series.  Understanding a percentage of the dialogue isn't good enough.","1768":"too stagy.  maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  did not even finish the first episode.  too boring to whatch this","1770":"VERY FIRST DISC WOULDN'T PLAY.TRIED FOR 2 MONTS FOR SATISFACTION FROM VENDOR\nWAS REALLY CHEATED.I FINALLY HAD TO ORDER ANOTHER SET","1772":"Satisfied with the timely delivery. Wonderful series, Amazon always accept returns and I had no worries. Expensive yes...but not for all the entertainment and such a wonderful series...I would buy again and may have to since my friends borrow series ALL THE TIME  Thanks Amazon..","1773":"we all like to nosey in to others' business and this gives us the perfect opportunity;I admit I enjoyed it.\nUnfortunately the set  I got had alot of background noise on it, but I muddled through regardless!","1774":"I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed Upstairs, Downstairs.  The characters are true to life for the era they were portrayed in.  The loyalty of the upstairs to the downstairs and the reverse was wonderful to watch.  The actors were excellent.  I completely got the feel of the way they lived and why they had their roles to follow and followed them flawlessly.  There were one or two exceptions but those belonged to the storyline.  I would recommend these videos.","1775":"After watching all the Downton Abbey that was available, I ordered this set and have really enjoyed it.  I would recommend it to anyone that is hooked on Downton Abbey","1776":"For years I was hoping to one day be able to see this series.  I have been watching for a few weeks and I am almost finished.  Watching Downton Abby gave me reason to order it now.  I must say this although it has nothing to do with my purchase, While watching Upstairs, Downstairs I realize how many similarities with Downton Abby......hmmm Never-the-less love Upstairs, Downstairs.","1778":"This complete series starts in 1903 and ends in 1920, featuring a family who lived in a great house in England ~ the lives of the people living upstairs and the completely different lives of those who lived below stairs.","1779":"A wonderful series great for a rainy weekend cozied up with cups of tea and occasional sherry. Marvelous cast, wonderful story and lovely nostalgia if you saw the original.","1780":"This series is not a happy one because it documents the unraveling of a family.\nbut at least one character has a happy ending.","1782":"I loved it so much, I wish it could have gone on and on.  I became so engrossed by the characters.  It was so much more than I expected. I never saw it in the 70s, and always was curious.  I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to view this series.  I will watch it again.","1783":"No so sure this is the WHOLE story.  Some series did not follow so well like there has been some edited??  But on the whole i enjoyed it very much.","1785":"Wonderful series. We were so sorry when it ended !! The next series is not nearly as good :(  Sorry to say!","1786":"This was my Christmas gift to me, and I just finished the last episode.  It is interesting to think about the lives of our ancestors and to place oneself into the storyline.  Hard to do without a Dowager Duchess!","1787":"bought this item as a gift for someone that I know who will absolutely adore it!! My favorite series of all times, at a great price","1788":"Mu husband saw all of these on PBS long ago and really wanted to see them again.  He is enjoying them just as much as the first time amd now I get to see what he was talking about.  These will be cherished forever in out household.","1789":"I started watching this on TV, but there seems to be a problem, in that they are not in order, so I purchased the 40th anniversary series and I absolutely love it, which there were more, love it","1790":"truly one of the finest pieces of entertainment-great acting and captivating story. It is addictive and you will love all the characters,good and bad. As much as I now love Downtown Abbey,this is superior.","1791":"Being an avid fan of Downton Abbey, I decided to buy Upstairs Downstairs. It was made much earlier than Downton and on a much smaller budget, so it's like comparing apples and oranges. I found 'Upstairs' to be as entertaining though and have even ordered the latest series which was produced a few years ago.\n\nI would give it a 'Buy' recommendation!","1792":"How is it the 40th anniversary collection of this Masterpiece classic does not have subtitles for the hearing-impaired? This show deserves a 6 star rating, but the subtitles are MISSING.","1795":"My Girl Friend wanted this for a Christmas Present, Oredered and it came very Quickly , Have not seen it it Yet , Do not open till Christmas, Happy with the Mail time","1796":"This is a real classic, and I highly reccomend it, I will Caution however, the series had not gelled yet in the first season, and I'll rate the first season at 2 stars, except for a few episodes, which I will rate at 4 stars; Starting with the second season I would rate it at 6 stars if allowed, there are super plots and acting.\n\nBuying the whole set is well worth the price","1797":"So glad to have found this show and this website!  Great service and great price! Thank you! Looking forward to more business!","1798":"Indeed .. this brilliant, classic series of the 70's remains absolutely unbeatable in every sense of the word. Even the most recent 3 episode series could not measure up to the original script and characters. It wasn't all that bad .. just not all that great. I so loved the \"Entire Original Cast and Settings\" .. if I could wave a magic wand and kinda do a little SyFy time travel .. you can be sure .. I would head directly to 165 Eaton Place in London.","1799":"LOVED it!!! I watched this on Masterpiece Theater and was hooked. Had to have it! If you are a fan of the show, this one will not disappoint! The cast, scenery, acting and writing were all superb! No wonder it is nominated for so many Emmys!!! Looking forward to the next installment!!!","1802":"A real CLASSIC!  Gave this as a gift to my mother, and she is totally entertained by it.  Another wonderful british show!","1803":"For those who like British drama, one cannot find much better than the series entitled \"Upstair Downstairs\".  It protrays a fictional family and their servants living through the peaceful times of the 1910's, through WWI, and on until the early 1930's.  It is a great story and wonderful acting and directing.  The characters are truely believable and \"alive\"!  My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed the series, and have recommended it to our friends.","1805":"As I have stated in many of my reviews, with technology changing so fast wait. Right now there is Blu-Ray, coming is 3D, so what are we supposed to do with all the expensive sets we have already bought? So far the current 3D Blu Ray players do not say they will play your current standard definition DVDs.","1806":"We have loved Upstairs Downstairs since it first aired--40 years, can it be that long?  We own the complete series on tape, but now that we are no longer young, we will repurchase this release because of the subtitles, which add so much enjoyment to Americans for British programs.\n\nUnlike many other reviewers, we care little for bonus material--give us the meat and give us the subtitles.\n\nNow if they would re-release Jeeves and Wooster and Rumpole of the Bailey with subtitles, our cup would runeth over.","1807":"My research indicates the American telecast's commentary by Alistaire Cooke that opened and closed most episodes is not included.  This is a real shame, as anybody who saw the original U.S. broadcasts will agree.","1812":"A very enjoyable series. A must have in any British collection for devotees of Masterpiece Theatre. Extremely entertaining.","1814":"Heard about this series all my life...finally bought it..and have problems understanding dialog....cast seems to mumble at times...and at others, talk so fast with the British accent that this Southern gal has problems hearing\/unstanding dialog.  love the cast... but am tired of \"backing up\" trying to get the gyst of the script","1815":"I bought this collection without ever seeing any episodes because I like British productions.  It is great acting and I have trouble turning it off!  I want to keep going onto the next and the next it is so good.","1820":"Life for servants and upper class in turn of the century England. Contains quite a bit of history and different sides of political issues. My favorite soap opera and show of all time.","1821":"This is the best series BBC has ever done. I have watched it over and over again and feel like part of the family. They draw you into their lives and it is a wonderful series. You will not be disappointed in it. I will not even lend out mine for fear of not getting it back. WONDERFUL","1823":"Upstairs\/Downstairs was a great series and having the ability to revisit with these marvelous characters whenever I want is marvelous.  I've wanted this set for years but I just couldn't afford it.  The deal offered here was absolutely fantastic and having Thomas and Sarah added in was the icing on the cake!","1824":"I just have received this set.  I have viewed the first 2 episodes and it is as well produced and written as I had anticipated.  I saw none of the productions during their initial showing.  I am truly looking forward to viewing this whole series this winter.","1827":"I've been a long time fan of this series.  I decided to purchase the whole set for my library since it is such an important mini-series.  It still holds up well today and is an excellent primer for understanding life before, during and right after WWI.  Also, it's fascinating to learn the structure of British society at the time and how much we have changed.","1829":"I have been enjoying this series very much.  The video quality of these shows on DVD is pretty good.  I was concerned about that after reading a review here but those concerns proved to be unfounded.","1836":"I purchased the first issuance of USDS when it first came out.  I returned it five times only to find out that the glitches were in ALL production issuance.  When I heard that USDS was to be reissued \"digitally remastered\" I was over joyed.  I have made it through about one half of the series.  It has been repackaged, but don't expect an improved picture quality. SHAME< SHAME A & E for a rotten reproduction of one of the best mini series of all time.","1838":"If one wants to see how the upper class use to live in Edwardian England and how it ended with the waste of World War I. Than this is the place to go to. The BBC has outdone itself with this one.","1842":"Upstairs, Downstairs is a really great show! After more than thirty years it holds up extremely well. The acting, the sets, the storyline, the scripts--everything about it is first class. It's one of my favorite TV series because it has characters and episodes that I, as a woman and author, can totally relate to.","1843":"I like the color film documentaries and this one is very satisfying.  The footage is pretty good and includes many scenes I have never seen before.  If you're a fan of the color film documentaries of WWII, this one should be in your collection.","1845":"This is a very solid video series for WWII.  In three episodes it chronicles the war as a whole.  As a teacher there are many chapters that can be selectively used in the classroom on a variety of WWII topics and themes.  Since it is in color, it is also more appealing to the students.  I recommend it to anyone with an interest in WWII and to history teachers as a classroom resource.","1848":"A colorful view of WWII. Mostly have only seen black and white WWII - this gives it a new depth.  I would recommend.","1850":"I enjoyed this athenic(to me anyways) step back in time to Nero Wolf's New York. Thought the characters were pretty close to the mark,especially Inspecter Cramer. Have read all the Nero Wolf books and if you enjoy them you will enjoy this video reproduction. Hope they come out with more.","1851":"I was amazed when I saw some of this as a child in color at a time when most films were black and white.  I thought that color film wasn't even invented prior to WW II.  Ted Turner can colorize anything these days, even WW I, but this is the real thing and you can tell.  Very nice indeed","1856":"I loved the true story of courage.  I objected to the cursing, because the reading I have done about Washington describes him as an introvert, and a God fearing man who constantly encouraged his men to pray, repent, fast and seek divine guidance for the cause of the revolution.  I think the frequent cursing was added to the story by script writers who thought the language would add drama to the situation, which it did not!","1857":"If you like history , this is a fime for you !","1859":"Jeff Daniels is one of my favorite actors. In this film he plays the part of Gen. Washington who leads his forces across the Delaware river to attack Trenton. Mr. Daniels plays the part of Washington with great humor, which of course in real life Washington never had. But Jeff Daniels makes Washington seem like a man you would follow, because he could lead.","1860":"good","1861":"good","1862":"My husband really likes special movies to fit the holiday. He really enjoyed the further truths and knowledge he gained from this movie.","1863":"great!!!","1864":"A true hero's story! Acted with great craft, and true realism.","1865":"Excellent!","1866":"shows why the capital city is named for him","1867":"Bad","1868":"NOT CLOSED CAPTIONED.  Not subtitled.  It is a great story if you have normal hearing but if you need closed captioning or subtitles you are out of luck.","1869":"Another great history lesson come alive ... worth the investment ...","1870":"Jeff Daniels does a fine Washington portrayal.","1871":"excellent !","1872":"This is one of my favorite movies that I can haul out and watch over and over especially at Christmas time. It sticks pretty closely to the historical event and has some humor as well. Jeff Daniels always looks just like whomever he is depicting. It's quite uncanny.","1873":"Great!  My son is a history buff, and said the accuracy of the weapons and uniforms was right on.","1874":"Good depiction of the problems faced by George Washington when chased by the British after the New York defeat and when crossing the Delaware Rivet to attack Trenton.","1875":"Great movie as it tells the story of the crossing of the Delaware river very well.  It really shows what the American must have suffered during that winter.","1876":"In insightful take on of the most important but nearly forgotten battles of the Ameican Revolution which had the longest odds and gambled the survival of independence in the most uncertain weeks of the war. Washington's crossing of the Delaware to attack Trenton is known more for a painting it inspired but  the film goes deeper into the battle that kept the cause alive and an army intact when defeat seemed inevitable.","1877":"Good movie.  Would recommend.","1878":"We saw this movie ages ago on cable, but it doesn't seem to air anymore. The acting is fantastic, and the movie dramatically tells the story of a turning point in the Revolutionary War. We watched it with our son, and he really liked it.","1880":"5stars","1881":"This is a most remarkable movie of a key episode of the Revolutionary War.  The characters are ALL wonderful and each memorable.  Daniels makes a most impressive Washington but all the actors are strong.  Have already watched it twice and will certainly watch it more.  Many thanks for the very quick service.","1882":"good historical take on history","1883":"Excellent support video","1885":"The dvd was in great condition and the movie was amazing!!","1886":"Great video","1888":"ok","1889":"Very good movie","1890":"This film is spellbinding. Jeff Daniels shows the human side of General Washington & gives a praiseworthy performance. I watch this DVD every several months & never grow weary.","1891":"As described  - Great bit of history - currently no issues","1892":"ok","1894":"Adequate, only because this is the only film I've seen about an important piece of American history.","1895":"Very good movie,I recommend it too any one interested in George Washington.","1896":"Every student of US History should watch this!!!","1897":"Well acted and more historically accurate than most. (Except that part where the men start singing in the dead of night as they row through the ice to surprise the enemy). It's a great story, well scripted and directed,  with lots of action. Worth watching and worth keeping in your library.","1898":"Excellent portrayals and great continuity throughout the film. The music was very good as was the attention to detail. I recommend this\nfilm to everyone who enjoys seeing a fine re-enactment of one of the greatest achievements in the Revolutionary War, led by George\nWashington, the most singular military leader and hero of the war.","1899":"Very pleased.","1900":"I love books about that era. The brave men and women who fought for our freedoms","1901":"interesting take on the crossing all thought conversation obviously imagined","1902":"I liked it primarily because it's a historical war movie. Not the greatest production, but when you consider how many movies we have from this period in our history, you won't get much better.\n\nI think Jeff Daniels did a fine job as Washington, though I DID like him better as Joshua Chamberlain.","1903":"I thought that it was great","1904":"well done!","1905":"Wonderful movie!  Great history and information about Washington and his army crossing the Delaware River during the American Revolution.  Really enjoyed this movie.  It really makes you appreciate the hardships and dedication of George Washington and his troops.","1906":"Good.","1907":"Not a bad movie at all, but lacks a bit of historical accuracy.","1908":"Wonderful movie and a lot of highlights that are very interesting.  Jeff Daniels does a fine job.","1909":"As a history buff, I really enjoy the Revolutionary war period pieces and the Civil War. Jeff Daniels  portrays people from both wars with style and excellent acting.","1910":"Excellent insight as to the struggles, determination, patriotism, & courage of the Father of our Country & his army.","1911":"Very good movie...Jeff Daniels portrayed him well.","1912":"Great movie I do enjoy my History stories lol","1913":"Well directed movie","1915":"The acting was really great.  It was quite enjoyable but seemed to differ on the character of George Washington.  He was known for not allowing cursing, for reading his Bible several times a day and praying.  I did not see any of these qualities displayed.","1916":"Great movie, my husband just loves it!","1917":"Just what we need: a screenplay by Marxist author Howard Fast on Washington's attack on Trenton.  A waste of the considerable talent of Jeff Daniels. Washington simply did not reason the way he is portrayed by Fast. This is what might have happened had Howard Fast been leading\nthe Revolution.","1918":"Great DVD, Fast Service, Thanks.","1919":"Great movie, especially if you love American history.  Professional and very well done.","1920":"Good movie","1921":"Very well done if a bit hammy in parts but a fun watch.","1922":"Very enjoyable.","1923":"One of the best American Revolution DVD's. Jeff Daniels shows Washington as resolute and a great tactician.","1924":"wonderful historical correct movie","1926":"Great movie.","1927":"a good rendition of the events in history","1928":"This is a very well-scripted and well-acted portrayal of this critical event in American History.  Washington's, faith, strength and courage come across well.  It made me appreciate how tentative the Revolution was, and how close we came to being subjects of the British Crown.  Very inspiring!","1930":"Jeff Daniels was a good choice to play George Washington in this historical drama recording Washington's famous crossing of the Delaware River and the raid on the Hession barracks at Trenton that ended in a rout victory for the Colonists. Well done.","1931":"This movie is one of the best on General Washington and the crossing of the Potomac!! A must for the history lover!","1932":"Great","1933":"The actors make the Revolutionary War come alive again. Henry Knox and George Washington are well played. Revolutionary War buffs will enjoy this movie. Make a trek up the Knox Trail to really bring this movie to life for you. Henry Knox Rox.","1934":"Very prompt!  Got it just before I needed it.  I teach American History in Junior High and the action was great to hold their attention while they learned history!","1935":"This is a great video to use as a teaching aid for homeschoolers to augment their other American history study lessons.","1936":"The only thing keeping me from giving this movie a 5 star rating is that the production was obviously on a limited budget. But true stories are the best stories, and the story of how dangerously close this nation came to losing the War for Independence is one that bears repeating. Our victory against the British was surely the result of Divine Intervention. There is a lot of great acting in this movie.","1937":"I saw this on TV and decided to get it to show the family every Thanksgiving.  It has great acting and it is very realistic in it's approach to the journey to America.  I will show it at school as well.","1938":"Unmistakably, one of General Washington's finest moments, this story is portrayed extremely well by Jeff Daniels and the rest of the cast. Well done!","1940":"Every has visons of Christmas morning - waking up, opening presents, But in 1776 Washington and te Continental Army crossed a nearly frozen Delaware River. This is that story. But this story goes into some personality traits and some of his men.  Highly recommended at a time when it has become chick to belittle our foundng father.","1941":"You might learn a little history about the American Revolution that was not taught in public school... I reccommend it for everyone.","1944":"A really great movie that keeps you riveted.  Does a great job at depicting just how ragged and ill Washington's troops were by this point in the war.  When you see just how close the entire endeavor was to defeat it makes you astounded that we sit here now 50 states strong.  With this one offensive Washington truly snatched victory out of the mouth of defeat.","1945":"The first ten to fifteen minutes of this movie had so much cursing in it our Family could not finish it. This movie IS A VERY POOR PORTRAYAL of George Washington's character!  It makes him out to be a fool instead of the person he himself was.  We shredded it so no one else would be subject to its filth and lies.","1946":"No close captions! No subtilies! pissing me off still.. end up gave that dvd to my mom. I love this movie.. I remember when I saw it on television once... man! freaking pissing me off when found out has no captions!","1947":"Jeff Daniels IS Washington.  Got tired of watching it on my old VCR and bought the DVD to watch it on my wide screen.","1948":"Will not will any awards but if you like American history you will find it entertaining. A different look at history.","1950":"Very well acted and the action was above average.  Was better than the regular TV fair.  Not sure of all the historical accuracy but movie flowed well and seemed well acted.  Always been a fan of Jeff Daniels so maybe a little biased.","1951":"I love this movie. great acting and very well done. I would definitely replace this movie if it becomes damaged","1953":"WE REALLY LIKED IT.  I WISH IT HAD BEEN LONGER.  THE ACTORS WERE GREAT!  PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE THAT AMERICAN COLONISTS WERE HAVING CHRISTMAS DINNER WHILE THEIR ARMY WAS COLD, HUNGRY, ETC.","1955":"My husband had seen this on TV and really liked it so I got it for him as a Birthday suprise. He was thrilled Thank You,","1957":"I love programs of this type. I thought it was quite enjoyable, despite the feeling that it could have been given a more in depth treatment. The Crossing by Howard Fast, upon which the program claims to be based was more of a rousing tale. To be fair, I generally am always a bit dissapointed when I view a movie based upon a book after having read the book, I generally prefer to find books listed as the source for a show I enjoyed, which always provides for me an enriching experience.","1958":"A story that every American needs to here. The supporting characters personalities are portrayed very well and accurate for the time period. Jeff Daniels does a solid job as Washington, but I was surprised at the crassness of language the screen writers added. I am not saying that Washington never spoke in such a manner, but in all the books that I have read, I have never come across a time that Washington spoke in such a manner. Still, the story is incredible... and true.","1959":"I'd seen this movie on A&E many years ago and wanted it in my collection. Despite a low budget it is an excellent historical piece. The movie brings history to life. We need more movies like this so that children will appreciate the sacrifice that has been made for us.\n\nYou'll want this movie in your collection. Please add your vote.","1960":"SO many people have done great reviews.  My heart goes out to the soilders who were freezing, had no food or shoes. If one stops and thinks about the sacrifices\nof 1700's americans, it makes you appreciate more than ever all your blessings.\nI admire the revolutionary generation (more than anyother generation)for their bravery and laying ground for americans 200yrs later.","1964":"Fairly well done, except for the rather rough language that the real Mr. Washington would never have used.\nFor a more realistic look at of our first president ,I recommend the movie John Adams.\nMr. Washington was a true gentleman.","1966":"This movie was well made, but had too much swearing in it. I understand that they were soldiers, but George Washington was a Christian and would not have spoken with so many profane words. We were only interested in the historical content of the film, but would only watch it once.","1968":"This movie was well done on every level. Good script, believable acting, excellent editing, great direction. I really liked the way Jeff Daniels portrayed Washington -- strong, understated and always believable. This movie works on every level and absolutely makes you feel like you're \"there\".  When a historical drama is able to make you feel transported back through time, it has succeeded.","1971":"Good films on the Revolution are hard to find.  This one was packed with action and the drama of Washington's last roll of the dice when the odds were so severly stacked against him.  The film is truly worthwhile, if only to further instill some patriotism in your kids and remind yourself what our ancestors went through to gain our independence.  And Washington would be a hard character to play:  unless your Jeff Daniels.  He nails it and truly captured the heroic aspects of that great man.","1974":"I purchased this DVD after seeing it on TV. It goes into detail on the true crossing of the Delaware by Washington and his troops during the crucial battle of Trenton, a turning point in the revolutionary war. There is a lot of bloodshed shown -just as it was in real life-.\n\nThis DVD may be more instructive than any history book, to a young person wishing to learn more about the revolutionary war.","1978":"The music made this terriffic film perfect- it was just excellent. The dvd also contains a behind the scenes special feature -which was good but not great. Jeff Daniels is great as George Washington, and has an excellent supporting cast. I thought the acting and emotion were terrific in portraying what Washington went through.. his army was being crushed and they needed to cross the Delaware and regroup to save the revolution. Good filming- an excellent production.. This is one of my favorite films.","1981":"\"The Crossing\" is one of the finest TV movies ever made. The movie is superbly cast, and led by Jeff Daniels, who surprised me with his outstanding portrayal of George Washington. Why he wasn't asked to reprise the role in \"Benedict Arnold,\" I'll never know! The crossing of the Delaware River and the Battle of Trenton are created with accuracy and excitement. This is a must-own movie for anyone who enjoys serious films! Grade: A+","1982":"Excellent, excellent movie!  I have watched it over and over and enjoy it just as much each time.  A&E movies are always well done and this is no exception!  The DVD version, as usual, gives you more for your money with background, actor interviews, etc.","1993":"Great buy and fast shipping!!!!","1999":"Excellent thanks!!!!","2000":"Good oldie!","2001":"Arrived on time and in great shape. Good action, intense at times. Love it.","2002":"great","2003":"I think this film is interesting.","2004":"I watched this movie when it was up for renting and I se","2005":"Can Harrison run for president now? Please?","2006":"I'm former military so I love this movie.","2007":"Thanks--Terrific movies.","2008":"Disappointing, to say the least.  Unfortunately the filmmakers have chosen to turn President Ford into some sort of cinematic action hero when the opportunity was there to do a thorough examination of his mishandling of Watergate.  Shame, shame...","2009":"Excellent.","2010":"Having fun watching these \"old\" movies.  Harrison Ford really does well with this one!","2011":"just what i wanted","2012":"Great movie","2013":"Not smart to piss off people in positions of power","2014":"Used--Works as advertised!","2015":"Good Movie","2016":"Just what I wanted and it arrived on-time!","2017":"Great movie, came as expected. A+ seller","2018":"I enjoy the movie and am replacing bus tapes.","2019":"I have this same movie on \"SuperBit DVD\" with DTS , and i know this blu-ray audio is recorded in Dolby True and it should look better but i want to hear which one will sound better or more dynamic..?","2021":"Replacing my VHS tapes and had to order this one. Love it.","2022":"Love it every time, suspenseful without scaring me","2023":"Loke","2024":"Great movie and it looks great on Blu-ray a classic 90's movie","2025":"This is a great action film about Harrison Ford who plays a president of the United States. Who kept a terrorist held in prison. And Gary Oldman who plays a hijacker and his people that he's with. And kidnaps everyone on board Air Force One. To give the demands to negotiate and have the prisoner released. This comes with commentary. I may recommend this to family and friends who may want to see this film.","2026":"Ok","2027":"Harrison Ford at his best in one fast-paced thrill ride !","2028":"Replaced both titles on DVD!","2029":"I really liked this movie. It has a great story line.","2030":"Another classic Harrison Ford movie!! Great movie!","2031":"Nice addition","2032":"This is a good action movie.  Terrorists highjack the Presidents plane with the President still on it.  He is a former marine and fights back.  HarrisonFord iis excellent as always.  Gary Oldman as the head villain is as well.  If you like action movies you will like this.","2033":"Great movie. You will cheer for America by the end. Colin Kaepernick has probably never seen it.","2034":"Excellent Movie - Very good acting - Believable.","2035":"Old but a classic worth watching.  This movie was made in the days when the plot was thinner and the violence was less gruesome (there's still plenty of killing).  I thought the acting was above average all around and Harrison Ford's was his usual excellent.  A good movie when you want some action with a little plot, but aren't in the mood to see heads getting chopped off and blood  spurting everywhere.","2036":"Best Harrison Ford Film Ever!!","2037":"Outstanding movie. My Mom and I love this movie.","2038":"Great movie!","2039":"Loved it!","2040":"This is one of my favorite movies!!!!  Excellent plot, excellent acting !!!","2041":"Another favorite great movie and wanted a dvd of it!","2042":"Entertaining action film.","2043":"Hey wonderful classic that I just replaced my DVD with a Blu-ray... Should have it in your collection...","2044":"I like the action packed movie","2045":"This is a must own film for any action fan.  Great tension throughout.  Although some scenes are pretty unrealistic, it makes up for it in terms of pure entertainment and action.  This is one of the few movies I have watched more than once, let alone twice.  I probably watch it at lest once a year.  The only negative I would say is that extras are severely lacking on the Bluray.  But it is still ABSOLUTELY worth owning, you will not regret it!","2046":"Harrison Ford portrays a president we all wish we had....one who is fearless and does the right thing.  Great action.","2047":"very good","2048":"Great entertainment!","2049":"Harrison Ford as President? You can't beat it.....Great movie","2050":"Always wanted this one on dvd thanks great.","2051":"My husband & I both like this movie, so I bought this to replace our VHS format.","2052":"We needed a replacement to our old DVD and if I can buy on Amazon Video we will.  Picture is crystal clear","2053":"One of my all time favorites.","2054":"Terrific!  A must see!","2055":"Very good action, but stretches the willing suspension of disbelief to the breaking point in my opinion. The idea that all those trained secret service agents could fire so many bullets in such close quarters and not even stop one hijacker is pretty unlikely. The agents were not very good at taking cover either.  Plus, even though it is just a movie, seeing all those guys get shot in the takeover scene is hard to watch.","2056":"Fantastic movie","2057":"Fun action movie with Ford as a believable President with a couple of slightly unbelievable scenes.  Great adventure and suspense.","2058":"awesome movie, wonderful price. arrived on time!","2059":"Some unnecessary bad language. Great plot and ending.","2060":"Harrison Ford is the man","2061":"great","2062":"I love it","2064":"Another intriguing movie starring Harrison Ford.","2065":"great movie","2066":"Love this movie! Action packed all the way. Suspenseful and thrilling!","2067":"good movie","2068":"good action and suspense","2069":"get off my plane","2070":"Excellent!","2071":"Had this on chaps and had to update to DVDs.  Love this movie. Action","2072":"Just a good movie worth every minute","2073":"love it.","2074":"Wonderful and with so much emotion","2075":"action packed","2076":"Good old movie...seeing it again after years!","2077":"Good. Movie","2078":"Cant go wrong with Harrison ...yummy","2079":"Heart stopping every time. Introduced our 11 year old grandson to it. Definitely one of his favorite lines now is \"Get off my plane!\"","2080":"awsome","2081":"Movie was amazing! Harrison Ford is always good","2082":"Its a good time at the house with some popcorn.","2083":"Good old edge of the chair movie.  Harrison Ford, as always, is excellent.","2084":"Classic Harrison Ford. I Think he though he was in a Star Wars Movie.","2085":"I really enjoy this movie.","2086":"Fantastic movie action","2087":"Good movie, great air plane scene at the end!","2088":"good older movie","2089":"now i can throw awat vhs","2090":"Awesome action and suspense!","2091":"Good movie","2092":"It's awesome","2093":"is a good movie and plenty of action.  I always enjoy Harrison Ford movies.","2094":"Riveting","2095":"Great movie when made and great movie now.  Stellar performance by all, especially Harrison Ford.","2097":"Olde but goodie","2098":"still relevant with intense shoot-out after all these years!  Good Friday night fun!","2099":"Great acting by main characters and supporting actors","2100":"Indiana Jones on a plane. What more could you ask for?","2101":"Great movie!!","2102":"Love this movie!","2103":"Good movie all the way thru. We really like this one.","2104":"My second time watching this one. Just as good as the first time.","2105":"This one is a popcorn-chewer of the first order!  Terrific performances by Harrison Ford and the always astounding Gary Oldman head an excellent cast in this wonderful nail-biting trip on the President's plane!  The blu-ray is a fine program release.","2106":"Have the VHS version.  VHS machine broke.  Enjoyed this movie so much just had to have it on Blu-ray to watch anytime we elected.","2108":"This one had been a challenge to find....","2109":"Great movie, one of Harrison's best!","2110":"High intensity, action packed and of course, the good guys always win.\n\nThe only thing I had an issue with was the talking was quite but the action was very loud...as if I was in a surround sound theater.  I turned on the caption and it was just fine.","2111":"love it","2112":"One of Harrison Ford's best! And I guarantee you'll find any excuse to say \"Get off my plane\" after you see it!","2113":"First of all, in my mind Harrison Ford can do no wrong. This is a great action film for the entire family. A definite classic! I got this product as a gift for my husband's father and it came exactly as expected. I would definitely recommend this movie and obviously, nothing is better than Blu-ray. =)","2114":"Updating my video library from VHS to DVD.  Great price and quick ship!","2116":"Great Movie!","2117":"Great movie!","2118":"Good movie.","2119":"Its Harrison Ford, as President, telling the bad guys \"get off my plane\". Love this awesome movie.  A classic.","2120":"Classic Harrison Ford","2121":"Great movie. Great blu-ray.","2122":"iLOVE IT.","2123":"Great movie","2124":"add on to my library :)","2125":"GET OFF MY PLANE! I wait for that line. Such a fun movie.","2126":"I've seen the movie.  It's a classic I wished to keep.","2127":"Two Wolfgang Petersen directed films together in one package is all you could want, with fine picture quality and all the extras from the old DVDs.\n\n\"Air Force One\" in particular is excellent.","2128":"Kept the viewer on the edge of their seat!  Some scenes were somewhat unrealistic, but overall, very good movie!","2129":"This could have been a 4 star movie but there are parts that are just pathetic and they are relatively frequent.","2130":"Wasn't the terrorist a famous actor too? Worth watching !","2131":"I never enjoyed this movie.","2132":"Harrison Ford do you really need to know any more. great cast also.","2133":"Nail biting suspense","2134":"Good quality and good move. Glad to see it on Blu-Ray. The story is a bit of a stretch but fun none the less.","2135":"Love the movie","2136":"Good action movie, I think a older Harrison Ford could have pulled this one off a little better, Gary Oldman was a very good choice as the bad guy!","2137":"This is a typical Harrison Ford completely over the top action flick. If you like this type of move you will enjoy this one as I did. If you prefer movies with some semblance of reality then this may not be for you","2138":"Pretty sure my husband liked this more than I did and would give it 4 stars.  It is a good movie with an exciting finish but has a pretty high body count.  Terrorist are not my idea of entertainment.","2140":"one of the best suspenseful dvd's ever produced! Harrison Ford nails this with outstanding character and emotion!","2141":"Harrison Ford at his best!  If you like an action movie filled with terrifying terrorist, paramilitary President of the United States--and hair-raising stunts that leave you clinging to the edge of your seat---than this film is right up your alley. Very entertaining.","2142":"Love it","2143":"I've watched this movie several times over the years. I enjoy it every time.","2144":"Great movie! Non stop action. It keeps you on the edge of your seat with suspense. The Russian boss had such a thick Russian accent that even though he was speaking English he should of had subtitles for just him never less it didn't take away from the awesomeness of the movie. Highly recommended to any Harrison ford and action movie lover","2145":"Pretty much a nail baited.","2146":"One of our favorites","2147":"Oh, to have such a man as our commander-in-chief!  But also, to have people who are willing to sacrifice their all to insure the continuity of our nation's constitutional \"mind.\"  It was a terrific, barn-burner of an action adventure film!","2148":"Great action flick!","2149":"I really like this movie. A movie with Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. What a combination!!!\nIt is unusual because so much of it takes place on the plane but it works.","2150":"One of my favorite movies.  Always love watching this. It's one you can watch over and over again and it never gets old.","2151":"I watched this movie after Harrison Ford's recent close call.  He has remained a bigger than life character both on and off the screen.  I've watched this movie several times since it was released.  It is probably the most heroic role that Ford has played.  Fun to watch again and again.","2152":"Very good Show","2153":"good old movie","2155":"Good movie.","2156":"If you like action and you like the president, you'll like this. Therefore we should think about electing Harrison Ford president. Otherwise forget it. You must have a president than likes America as well as himself for a change or forget it. Would this movie work today?  I doubt it. So just use your imagination and enjoy the movie while you can.","2158":"Harrison Ford knows how to protect an airplane, but I wish he would not fly his personal planes over homes. Although I'm impressed with how well he recovered from a mechanical failure of his plane on a golf course and wish him good health in the future.","2159":"Full of action and a great movie for Harrison Ford fans","2160":"Great product!","2161":"Great movie I can't wait to  watch it again.","2162":"This was a typical movie that would come out in the mid 90s of a terrorist taking over a commercial aircraft, the hero saves the day kind of thing.  What was awesome about this movie is the fact terrorists took over Air Force One with the President still on it, but ironically with the President being a maverick ex-air force pilot himself takes it into his own hands to defeat the terrorists.  The good guy wins.  And of course it was awesome because the president was Harrison Ford","2163":"This is one of the best movies I have seen!  Harrison Ford is the greatest  in this movie!  Edge of your seat !!!","2164":"Very exciting but too much at the end of the movie.","2165":"Good","2166":"Good Movie but rather dated.  The acting was very good and it is a great lesson in how our world has changed in the years since this movie was made.  I wonder how much more tech. the new Air Force One is compared to the one in this movie.","2168":"OK, I'll say it.  If Harrison Ford ran for president I would vote for him.  This movie is packed with suspense, thriller and action with just enough sentiment to make it a straight up action flick.","2169":"This movie has everything. Fast pace, good verses evil, suspense","2170":"A very good movie that still keeps your attention all throughout.  I found it as good as when I first watched it several years ago.","2171":"Have had this movie for many years and one of Harrison Ford's best.  It is full of action and great other actors.","2172":"Love Harrison Ford.  Action packed and the good guys win.","2173":"One of the greatest movies ever made!  love this movie!","2174":"Excellent movie,  I give it 10 star's","2175":"I had this in VHS, so I wanted it on DVD.","2176":"Love (almost) anything with Harrison Ford!","2177":"Excelente","2178":"Great blu-ray transfer. No defects.  Picture and sound seem brand new.","2179":"love it","2180":"Good story line. Harrison (good guy) does not disappoint and neither does Gary Oldman (bad guy)","2181":"GREAT MOVIE","2182":"Great movie, I had already seen it several times, it just remains awesome.","2183":"This is a great, old, classic action flick with a fairly young Harrison Ford.  I've seen it many times and still enjoy it.","2184":"The movie was action packed but predictable. This was a cookie cutter plot of many other similar films.","2185":"Great, action family (14+) movie. Violence (killing)","2186":"Love this movie ~ great go to movie when you need a little drama, excitement, and Harrison Ford.","2187":"I ordered this for my husband because he had watched it previously and enjoyed it.  I asked him how it would rate it and what I indicated is what he decided.","2188":"Nice movie","2189":"Harrison playing Harrison, a shot em up, interesting premise.  Gary Oldman, he always blows me away with his performance.  Great as Smiley in Tinker","2190":"Great movie! Amazon needs to add more action films, such as this one, to the site. We members pay a hefty membership fee, and shouldn't have to pay any additional money to rent or even purchase the movies.","2191":"Love it!","2192":"I have seen it before so I did not see the whole thing but it is worth seeing. If you like unreal stuff it is good fantasy","2193":"We were on the edge of our seats through  the whole movie.  It was awesome!","2194":"I really like this movie.  It is a classic in Harrison Ford's filmography.  Gary Oldman is the perfect villain - he has been for over the last 10-15 years it seems like minus his role as Sirius Black in the Harry Potter films.  Ford is great as usual, the likable badass president. Who can forget the classic line from this movie:  \"Get off my plane!\"","2195":"Excellent, action filled and edge of your seat tension.  Really good movie.","2196":"Just like most Harrison Ford flix.... very well done.","2197":"It was taut and exciting as most of Ford's movies are.  I think he is an awesome actor...and Gary Oldman was fantastic as the enemy.  If you like action and minimal bad language, sex, etc...but lots of action, this is a good movie for a cold night at home.  ;-)","2198":"One of my favorites.  Anything with Harrison Ford in it will get 5 stars.  Very good.","2199":"Classic collector for those who love HF.","2200":"Good movie, Good action","2201":"old movie","2202":"Classic Great movie!","2203":"Seen it a number of times, always enjoy watching it again and again but with a few years in between.","2204":"I've watch this before a couple times it's a real nailbitter  and worth the watch\nI really enjoyed seeing the movie again","2205":"Non-stop action, fine, if not subtle Harrison Ford.  Pleasantly unlikely plot, with an odd undercurrent of executive and cabinet irresponsibility. Oldman stronger, and more restrained, than he sometimes is--and with an accent to boot.  Shocking number of dead bodies, however, too much carnage to give the deaths any dramatic (or human) sting.","2206":"Arrived quickly and a good price. No problems.","2207":"Just a wonderful story....great action","2208":"Thrilling.","2209":"Used to have it on DVD. Now that I have it on Blu-ray, it's so much better!","2210":"This has been a favorite movie of mine since its release. It is non-stop action from beginning to end. Harrison Ford is excellent in his role as the President. Gary Oldman is one of the scariest bad guys you'll see in a movie. I enjoy this film every time I watch it. It is well worth the time to watch it.","2211":"good action flick, seen it before and watched it again without any boredom. sneaking around, shooting, planes falling apart........what more could a person want.","2212":"Same old script with the President who takes the terrorists on his own. Entertaining if you want complete fantasy and the Amercan hero who can do no wrong.","2213":"Great story, fun.","2214":"This is how our government should control terrorism.","2215":"Nice production!","2216":"BOUGHT AS A GIFT.","2217":"Very fast service..great price","2218":"I LOVE this movie!! Harrison Ford is a kick-a$$ president! We need a guy like this in office now!","2219":"Best action movie. Best actor Harrison ford","2220":"It was just ok, some scenes was just so unbelievable!  For example, guns firing off in an airplane....really!? and there is no aftermath regarding the plane!? Hmmm, not believeable.","2221":"love it!\nits one of my favorite old movies!\nit is also very interesting to see the underlying theme of self confidence, perseverance, determination, unity, sacrifice, optimism, and trust throughout the movie. which was the nation's feeling and identity in the pre-911 days.\nAnd Gods i miss the good old America","2222":"Always was good","2223":"It's a good movie.  I have seen it several times.","2224":"A little hard to believe,but Ford makes it great.","2225":"Will keep ypu on the edge of your seat!","2226":"Pretty good movie, thought I had seen all of his movies.  Like it very much","2228":"a brilliant and bold story is very entertaining, and Mr. Ford provided great performance which had held this movie up to rather height.","2229":"Exactly what you should expect from a summer blockbuster. Exactly.","2230":"Good movie, if you don't put much attention to the improbabilities, you'll enjoy this movie.","2231":"I Love this movie. This is probably the third or fourth time I've watched it and I still like it. Good action and drama - and reasonably believable too.","2232":"A little far-fetched, but a good movie for those days you  just want to be entertained.","2233":"Amazon is the best place in the world to buy DVD's. Almost always have what you want, great prices and super fast delivery. I couldn't ask for anything more.","2234":"None","2235":"No one can beat Harrison","2236":"I've watched it several times, a good one !","2237":"suspensefull","2238":"sorry ,my internet speed isn't that good, couldn't watch the but 10 minutes of the movie.","2239":"Great action packed movie! Harrison Ford really delivers in this one! You won't be bored watching this one!","2240":"What a heap of steaming DUNG......","2241":"Great action flic. A bit dated but not so much that you would notice. Acting is good considering the type of movies. Yea, some of it is a bit far fetched but hey...........its a movies. Enjoy!!!","2242":"Impossible venues, can fire a gun in a plane with major damage.  When a black box is chopped up with an axe, a second one does not come available.  If a man is suck out of an opening, how can other men pull in a second man with only one hand?  Impossible events.","2243":"Can't go wrong with a traditional Harrison ford action flick, he's great","2244":"Great action flick.  Ford is the man.","2245":"Well, it is stirring even though it has many unbelievable plot devices that strain credibility.","2246":"Great film; Harrison Ford at his peak.","2247":"Great action movie!","2248":"For pure action, this movie is hard to beat. Harrison Ford is at his best.","2249":"exciting and well performed. cinematography amazing. but predictable.","2250":"I watched this move for a second time after seeing it years ago.  It is still good and exciting.","2251":"Really like this feel good action adventure movie.","2252":"Another fannytastic drama with the very great actor, Harrison Ford. There is one flaw right up front; the terrorists who came on board with the President would have never passed security; in fact, what happens at the beginning would never happen in reality. All these unknown men about nine of em just get onboard Air Force One, and it is not clear why security failed to apprehend any of them. This is glossed over fast. I think it's another great H. Ford movie nonetheless.","2253":"ALWAYS A GOOD OLDIE","2254":"WOW!! what action","2255":"1st rate thriller.  I muse at the one star ratings from people who probably find fault with everything in life that they did not create themselves....if they ever did anything","2256":"So impressed by the first 5 minutes, repeat it many times.","2257":"Can't get better than this one.","2258":"One of the best Harrison Ford movies I've ever seen!  If you like lots of action, then this is the movie for you !!!!!","2259":"Missed it at the movies.  Now with PRIME how easy.  Good action flick, a little predictable but enough to make you guess a little.  Great action sequences.  RECOMMENDED for the action flick people.","2260":"Harrison Ford did a great job as president and love this movie alot.","2261":"great job","2262":"Great blu-ray.  If you like the movie, you'll love the Blu-Ray.","2263":"excelllent!!","2265":"I had not seen this movie in quite some time.  A great performance by Harrison Ford and the villain is one that is hard to forget.  I enjoyed watching this movie again.","2266":"Great","2267":"As always,Harrison Ford is a fine actor in most of his productions. Widescreen No rating","2268":"I watch this many time in dvd & now on Bluray with Clear picture & good sound efect.","2269":"Great!","2270":"Even though its an old movie, my husband would have us watching it over and over again.  Now he can watch it in the privacy of our bedroom and not the family room. Thanks for having so many movies available on hand.","2271":"This film is a definite must for any fan, young or old. It is hillarious,  with great new versions of older songs, with awesome performances of thier  first ones. Older fans, keep in mind that it is a senseless comedy, and  gets awfully hokey sometimes, but the movie never takes itself seriously,  so you it's dumbness is forgiven. To make up for it, seasoned movie buffs  will have fun spotting all the cameos, especially if you pay close  attention to brittish television.  END","2272":"Harrison Ford, what else can you say on par with his Tom Clancy movies","2273":"loved it","2274":"Ford at his best","2275":"This is good movie,so exciting! I so love it!","2276":"love it","2277":"Great movie especially if you like Harrison Ford","2280":"Ok","2281":"DVD edition. A wild ride from start to finish.  Don't you wish your thirty round magazine held so much ammo or your heroes had such integrity and ability?  An exciting fantasy adventure and not just for the first watch.","2282":"I always loved this movie.","2283":"Every minute is suspenseful and action packed.","2284":"The quality is excellent. It's finally good to have this movie on blu-ray.\n\nAlthough, if you have a separate bass speaker, don't turn the volume up too far or you'll vibrate the floor. lol.","2285":"One of my favorite movies.","2286":"My favorite Ford movie tied with The Fugitive...my fav male actor!!!  The airplane trip was horrifying knowing what happened really could.  Ford at his best!!  When he looks angry, he is real!!!  My husband and I collect Ford movies and can't wait to watch this one again!!","2288":"nice","2289":"Very Satisfied","2290":"This movie is so great and timeless. It almost beat titanic at the box office opening weekend no joke.\nIt would be awesome if they did another movie.","2291":"Very entertaining and a blast from the past.","2292":"my daughter enjoyed the movie, she said it took her back when she was in middle school","2293":"Arrived on time and in excellent condition. A good action movie that as usual shows off Harrison Fords acting ability. The movie in of its self I thought is good and well paced good action thru out with what I thought as a happy ending. I watch it from time to time and always enjoy it. Its one that I have put in my collection you might too. I recommend this movie highly as well as the seller.","2294":"all is great","2295":"I don't normally do reviews, but AF 1 always gives me a lift when I see it.  No, I don't agree with some of the stated policies of the characters, but I feel it does exemplify the dedication of our service people to our way of life.  I hope anyone who sees it can find that same spirit of service and diligence to duty that is exemplified here.","2297":"excellent product and fast delivery","2298":"A great cast, a believable story with great performances. Super visual effects.","2299":"Great classic movie. Always entertaining. We had this movie on VHS now glad to own it digitally.","2300":"Daughter loves the movie","2301":"I bought this for nostalgias sake and I love it!","2302":"This was one of my favorite groups as a kid in the 90s I used to have this on VHS tape  as a kid I watched this every day in happy I found this on here","2303":"So this before, one of my favorites","2305":"An older one, but had to watch it again because it was a good movie then and a good movie now.","2306":"My husband likes this movie very much.  It is one of his favorites.  We pretty much like anything Harrison Ford.  In our opinion, he is a great talent.  Air Force One has a very creative story line with a lot of action that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  We are replacing an old VHS tape with this DVD.  This is a very good movie.","2307":"everything it is ok and everything it is all right. Thank you for the shipments.\nIt is wat i want\nbest regards","2308":"But then you can be dumb and do dumb things in a movie and have it all work out. Other than that, not a bad movie.","2309":"scam","2310":"My Granddaughter loves it.","2311":"While the basic story line is not that believable, the cast pulls it together and somehow makes it entertaining. Lots of action and Gary Oldman is such a nasty character to Harrison Ford's good guy role. I enjoy the movie since part of it was filmed in Columbus, Ohio and a former co-worker's relative did the lighting for the night scene with the 747 in an airport. A good action vehicle for Ford.","2312":"I had this one on DVD and loved it, but The blue-ray is the BOMB. One of my all time favorites.","2313":"Great action, with some unbelievable stunts.  Hamilton Ford serves up another fine performance as a beleaguered President who saves the day. Supporting members all do a wonderful job, even the villains.  Just found out that the jailed Russian opposition leader also played the U-boat captain in Das Boot, worth checking out.  But Air Force One remains on my favorites list.","2314":"Wow, is all I can say about this movie. I have had it for years on VHS and it was one of my favorite movies; decided it was time to get it on Blu-ray.\n\nIncredible story of honor and courage in the midst of a hostile take over...one I think every President should watch and inspire to be! Harrison Ford is an amazing actor and portrays the true Presidential standard...honor, country, God, and Family!\n\nLove it, Love it, Love it!","2315":"Among all the fictional presidents in dramatic roles, Harrison Ford has to rank among the best. This story has the feeling of a Tom Clancy novel which makes you feel like Ford is reprising his role, since Jack Ryan does become president in the Clancy books. He's not Ryan in this case, but his character's courage, foibles and actions will keep you on the edge of your seat and make you want to cheer.","2316":"Childhood favorite","2317":"Funky costumes and sassy girl power - need I say more? :)","2318":"Like the campy movie.","2319":"Love it. Such a  goofy sense of humor from the girls.","2320":"Thanks! Love it! Fast shipping","2321":"blast from the past","2322":"Fills me with a patriotic feeling, every time. Even when there's a president in office who doesn't deserve that of me, in a time when no one remembers what patriotism and national pride even is.\n\nGreat movie and the only way to play it on a decent HD system.","2323":"One of Harrison Fords last great action movies.  If you are a Harrison Ford fan, this one will not disappoint.","2324":"My daughter loves Harrison Ford so we added this for her collection.  Great price during the Christmas season. Shipped promptly.","2325":"We really love this movie and have watched it many times.  We love Harrison Ford.  He is really good in this movie","2327":"The quality of sound and lifter was great and I was ridiculously excited to find the movie!","2328":"I brought this for my nephew and he really enjoys it!","2329":"By far my favorite musical.","2330":"daughter loves","2332":"Found it at a great price. Glade I checked with amazon. It's nice to be able to find items when you are looking for them.","2333":"A very exciting movie. I always love it when the good guys win. It is somewhat realistic in that the bad guys win on a few levels, but in the end - it's the good guys. Shows a strong President, and people supporting him. You will want to wave the U.S. flag. You will want Harrison Ford as President!","2334":"This is one of the best movies Harrison Ford has starred in (next to Indiana Jones).  The color and clarity on this blu-ray\nis great.","2335":"I am very grad I purchased this Blu-ray.  It is a movie I can watch over and over.\nWatching it on a big screen really makes it special too.","2336":"It you enjoyed the Spice Girls you'll like Spice World. Just a long music video with them on a big bus. A few stars pop in and out to spice it up - wink wink. You can see Alan Cumming before he was on The Good Wife. If you've got a free afternoon and like the spice girls pop this in and sit back for the right. Get up and dance if you like.","2337":"Childhood movie. Courteous service thank you.","2338":"My wife really really wanted to see this. I guess she just had a sudden and overwhelming urge to revisit her childhood. Anyway, as a grown man who was never into this type of music, I couldn't even make it past the first 15 minutes... and it felt like an epic struggle to last that long.","2339":"I love this movie","2340":"Funny and entertaining.","2341":"I forgot how terrible this movie was.","2342":"The best part is playing \"spot the cameo\" with a generous double handful of guest actors. Not a fan and I still enjoyed it for the campiness.","2343":"one of Ford's best lines ever...\"get off of my plane\"....kind of sums it up.  Oldham really makes u hate him.","2345":"I've seen this movie several times, but never get tired of it.\n\nGary Oldman and Harrison Ford are awesome.\n\nSpecial effects just don't get any better.......great story!","2346":"Great Movie love to watch it over and over.  Can't go wrong with Harrison Ford in the lead role .","2348":"All of the movies I have ordered in the past couple of years are sent directly from Amazon to my grandson in Ohio  who is terminally ill.  The movies are his choices and he is happy with them.","2349":"Lots of action, thrills and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. Harrison Ford is great again, a wonderful movie I will recomend to those who are Ford fans.","2350":"Not what I remember but as a kid loved this movie. Maybe you need to be a kid to enjoy?","2351":"Always loved the SpiceGirls!","2352":"I love this movie. So many good memories","2353":"Very enjoyable film","2354":"This story is a favorite of mine Harrison Ford as P.O.T.U.S. versus one of movies all time bad guys in Gary Oldman who will in this ultimate winner take all plenty of twists and turns great family movie gotta have it very coveted","2355":"Great movie and fast shipping. Movie looks and sound great. Like new. Movie will always be a good watch. I can watch it numerous times and never get tired.","2356":"One of my all-time favorites. I love all of Harrison Ford's movies. The price was great, fast shipping, love it, thank you.","2357":"they do a job on time.  i wel buy form them sametime. wich the dvds on ps3 or dvdplay. i","2358":"I love Harrison Ford and have almost all his movies.  This movie was in excellent condition.  Thanks so very much.","2359":"Loved the movie in the theater and love watching it again. Who doesn't want to see their president fighting back against the bad guys!? Just wish there was less profanity.","2360":"I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing.  They are all good movies and received in great condition.  They make a good additions to my collection.  Thank you for very good service.  I do not buy movies any where else online but Amazon.  I feel they are safe.","2361":"What a performance by Harrison Ford! If you have not seen or purchased this movie you need to. It's a must have for your movie collection! Could this happen to an American president? Watch this movie & guess for yourself.","2362":"A great action pack movie. Alot of good acting from everyone in the movie. Well written story and produce. A real thiller.","2363":"great movie","2364":"This is the best movie ever, hands down.","2365":"I have shopped online enough to become, sometimes, overcome by the frustration involved with someone selling me bad product. After all this I cant tell you how much I appreciate someone that delivers quality for a good price...it saves me all the pain and headache as well.","2366":"love this movie and felt it was one of Harrison Fords best, although it would not have been without Gary Oldmans superbe antignistic role of the bad guy.  Oldman is a surperb actor in every role I have seen him play.  :Love any movie that has a patriotic theme and \"Air Force One\" fits that description","2367":"It may have seemed pretty good when it came out but in retrospect this is one lousy movie. Clearly high raters are rah rah Americans. Much overacting on almost everyone's part. Harrison is just horrible. Actually he's never been very good has he?","2368":"This is one of my favorite movies.  Harrison Ford's portrayal of the president is exactly what we need in the US.  He is a man of character, strength & integrity.  And he doesn't back down or compromise his beliefs.  I highly recommend it!","2369":"reminds me of when I was younger. Love it","2370":"One of my favorite movies as a kid.","2371":"very good movie","2372":"As a kid growing up I used to listen to the Spice Girls I used to own this movie in VHS but never found it. So I bought it on DVD and still like to watch it once in a while.","2373":"Unfortunately, I have seen this garbage flick plenty of times.  My now 27 year old daughter was a huge fan back in the day so like many parents, I suffered through it.  Now since she is married and with a daughter of her own, I figured this would be a great nostalgic gift for her and I was right.  She loved it, her daughter was unimpressed and her husband isn't happy at all since she watches the movie quite often.","2374":"Air Force One is a good action movie with great actors.  It's a predictable movie, but still very fun to watch and pass the time.  If you're looking for a good family movie or are a strict parent with what your kids can watch then I highly recommend this movie.  There's mild violence and mild language, but still fun to watch and own.","2375":"This is one of my favorite movies, It starts a little slow as the plot develops, but then it is non stop action. This kept me on the edge of my seat. That's why I bought it, I liked it enough that I knew I watch it more than once. I don't buy movies that I won't watch more than once. If you have never watched it, I think you like it and if you have this would make a great addition to you collection, a must have in my book.","2376":"Impeccable production of a wildly absurd story. . .\n\nThe US president single-handedly (or nearly so) takes on a half-dozen extremely well-armed terrorists, carrying out feats worthy Bond, James Bond. But everytime he gives in when the leading terrorist threatens the president's wife or daughter. In addition to the absurdities, i also find it unpleasant to see the US president being tortured and degraded by the terrorists. Also, the director seems to use the movie to promote his personal politics.","2379":"The product arrived fast and was of great quality, no complaints here.  I have nothing else to say, it was perfect.","2381":"Great movie from the 90's. Just silly but the Spice Girls were funny playing themselves. Especially Geri (Ginger Spice) and Victoria (Posh Spice).","2382":"bought for 5 year old, she loves it.  My daughter grew up watching this movie and now her daughter has it","2384":"One of the most memorable scenes for me was when Harrison Ford hid behind one seat but turned the neighboring seat to make it look like he was crouched there instead. So when he jumped out and attacked the hijacker I got a nice jolt. This masculine thriller has good pacing and acting but there were a few amateurish special effects that detracted from its realism.","2388":"I am not a big fan of Harrison Ford's work but there have been a few films that I have enjoyed with him in it.  Air Force One is very entertaining with a lot of action and suspense.  The special effects are quite good as well with a lot of different and neat tricks to them.  Overall, if you enjoy action\/suspense type movies be sure to give it a view.\n\nPeter J. Miller","2390":"My nieces loved this as kids & I figured that it would bring back lots of fun memories.","2391":"Just a movie of people doing things and some good flashbacks","2392":"great movie, very entertaining!","2393":"Great family fun movie!","2394":"So much fun. Blah blah blah world peace, Girl Power!","2395":"Excellent movie- I had to upgrade from the DVD.\nSound is impressive.  The visual effects could have been a little better- mainly in the jet dogfighting scenes.","2396":"I love this movie and I was very excited to find it a such a great price. It arrived on time and in perfect condition.","2397":"Wonderful that Amazon.com has the DVD's I want at a very reasonable price. Since I found Amazon.com, I haven't shopped anywhere else. Am very thankful for the services they have. Excellent service all around Amazon!!","2399":"Love air force one. We've one this movie for awhile. But I've been all the sudden watching it. Not cause of harrison ford, but Gary oldman. I think he's cute\/attractive. EVeryone did a good job. \"GET OFF MY PLANE.\"","2401":"Harrison Ford portrays the President of the US. VERY GOOD movie! I really enjoyed it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat & is very action packed! 5 stars!","2402":"Excellent. Fast delivery and just as described","2403":"Good","2404":"my daughters love this movie","2405":"Guilty pleasure!","2406":"Bought as a gift for my wife. She loved it!","2408":"This movie is so packed with action that you are on the edge of your seat through the whole show. Harrison Ford plays a fantastic role as the president, and is his usual admirable self. Good Movie!","2414":"just like the VHS version i owned as a kid. great to watch when i need a throw back!","2415":"It's great!  I seem to be running a bit behind with these.  My bad.","2416":"Bought for my sister for Christmas,  she was excited to watch it again after so many years","2417":"Awesome!","2418":"A wonderful movie; positive, fun, funny, and all the girls do is 1. Make fun  of themselves and each other and 2. Make fun of the fact theya re so famous. No one seems to get: They are in the joke, they get it. The thing here, the group is actually good, and has good songs. I am an unapologetic fan, and my music goes into obscure electronic and jazz avant garde stuff. NOTHING is as avant garde and The Spice Girls. I still want a reunion!!!","2419":"It's for the granddaughters (six and nine) cute.","2421":"My childhood...That is all :)","2422":"Spice Girls","2427":"This is a great film, and it will be even better on Blu-Ray. I am excited that this is finally being released on Blu-Ray in the US.\n\nHarrison Ford turns in a great role as the President.\n\nThe TrueHD Audio should sound awesome - especially the action scenes.\nI highly recommend.\n\nEDIT: I have now seen this movie and it is AWESOME! The video and audio are superb.","2429":"loved them all keep them all coming thanks and have a happy and wonderful but safe New Year.","2430":"I just love the British accent and the Spice Girls were not half bad.  The story line was fast paced and it flowed for a Musical as such.  The Spice Girls will not let you down with their Hip Hop song style that you can't watch without falling in love with them.","2431":"Awesome!!!","2432":"This is filled with Spice Girls music. It gives the audience a taste of what being a pop star is like. The movie show the girls on tour, in photo shoots, in publicity stunts, and at concerts. The Girls are silly, sexy, and adorable. The concert at the end was Pure Spice.\n\nAnyone looking for a silly movie, to pass a few hours, this works. Anyone nostalgic for seeing and hearing the Spice Girls this is great.","2433":"Perfect! Thanks!","2434":"So excited to own one of my favorite movies of my childhood arrived on time and the packing was great","2435":"great movie, worth the price.... classic","2436":"As I said with Xanadu this is a fun movie with a set of adorable girls and its nice to have G movies still around that aren't horrible dumbed down affairs.","2439":"This is probably one of the best Action Movies ! Harrison Ford is the President from the USA, and his plane was hijacked!! Excellent movie !","2440":"I thoroughly enjoyed this action packed movie.  Harrison Ford is amazing in this movie.  Thank you.","2445":"This is one of my favorite Harrison Ford Movies!!\nIf you like action movies, you'll like this one!!\nI would rate this movie a 4 of 5 stars!!","2446":"Not for me..but my daughter was happy","2447":"Love it! Great condition! Works great!","2448":"Loved this movie as a young gal and wanted it for my kids!","2449":"love the movie","2450":"Love this movie","2451":"AWESOME!! Great quality, plays great. Very happy, wanted this movie forever, loved this movie when I was younger lol, great price for great merchandise","2452":"Excellent transaction and product!","2453":"Harrison Ford should have been a President... He is great in this movie and could save the world....","2454":"There are some unrealistic elements to this movie, but only when you stop and think about it.  It's an action movie and there will always be some stretches of reality.  Harrison Ford delivers as does his supporting cast.  It will pull you into the story without any real trouble, you will find yourself routing for the President and telling the evil guys \"take that\".  In the end, you will feel good about it and you may even be inspired by it.  Enjoy!","2456":"This is a good movie and will keep you watching all the way through. Harrison Ford is excellent in this and the supporting cast is good as well.  The plot is revelent with all the current world situations. The ending makes you want to cheer!","2458":"My DVD's insert had one movie exec (probably the producer) saying that only Harrison Ford could pull off the role of the US President. Harrison was absolutely convincing as a president \"who knows how to fight\", as one of the movie's characters put it.  He exuded decisiveness, compassion, regret and strength.  No wonder that one of the fighter pilots sincerely praises him, \"Sir, you did great!\"","2459":"This movie came out a couple years ago, but still today it's a great action movie.  After watching this it makes you feel good about being an american.  Anyways, Harrison Ford said he's ready for another Indiana Jones films.  I'm not sure if or when that will happen.  This is a great movie still.  Its worth buying, no question...","2460":"thanks","2461":"classic.","2462":"This is not great art. It is just a silly, fun, lighthearted movie. If you take it for what it is, it's a pleasant way to pass the time.","2463":"I love this movie it is one of my all time favorite movies. The first time I watched I loved it","2464":"This movie is basically the modern version of one of the Beatles movies but modern day and with an all female band. It is good pre-teen, pj night with pizza movie night type of thing.","2465":"I had ordered this for Not only my friend, but my Boss at work. She loves it. Thank you and have a great day","2466":"I bought this for my sister for Christmas.  We loved the Spice Girls in elementary school and we had this on VHS when we taped it off the TV.  So great to have it on DVD, I just need to buy one for myself!","2470":"This is a very very very very good movie, action lovers would love it!!! Harrison Ford does a great job in the acting. Gary Oldman's pretty good, could be better. 5 stars baby!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","2472":"This was a masterpiece. If anyone remakes this movie I will gut them like fishes. It had great CGI. The bad part was the clouds looked like snow. Anyway if someone remakes this film I will gut them because this is Wolfgang's masterpiece not yours. And if Peter Jackson decides to remake it don't see it because it will more likely be more than three hours.","2473":"It came in great condition and I can't wait to watch it with family and friends. MOVIE NIGHT AT MY HOUSE!!!!","2474":"I don't know why I like this movie, but I do. It is mildly amusing and I like to put it on the tv while I am doing housework.","2481":"Great DVD The package came fast it was new not broken and a good price I couldn't pass it up. I have a good collection good DVDs and like to add on from time to time this was a steal and I decided to purchase it Ive seen it before but wanted in my collectionGOOD Movie\/GREAT Price!","2482":"You really had to have grown up in the 90's to understand the awesomeness of this movie.  I mean what young girl in the 90's didn't love the Spice Girls?  They were all unique and they had such great success with what they did which not many girl groups can say!","2488":"Another great performance by Harrison Ford. This is a nice action film that moves along quickly, making it wonderful entertainment!","2491":"If you don't love the spice girls then don't buy the movie, pretty obvious to the people who brought it and didn't like it. I was and still am a fan of them, the music made up for some of the bad acting. Of course the movie is corny, they are Singers! But for god sakes they act better than some of the \"actors\" out there.","2492":"I got this movie when it came out I have it on vhs the acting is dumb really chressy movie there singing is good but not a good movie there dumb in it I love the spice girl but this movie is not really movie I did not like it","2493":"I used to love this movie when I was a kid and when I found it on DVD i was so excited!! Love this movie!! Spice Girls 'Viva Forever'! :)","2494":"Harrison Ford continues his top billing streak with this exciting film about terrorists hijacking the President's plane.  He proves his star power in the title role.  Gary Oldman is errie as the leader of the rag-tag group of thugs.  He is one of the best villans in Hollywood today.  Check it out!","2495":"Ford plays a president whose toughness nobody can deny! When his plane is hijacked by terrorists, he sends everyone else to safety, including the Secret Service, and goes after the bad guys himself to rescue his wife and daughter. Harrison kicks major(...)and his furious, grated line, \"GET OFF MY PLANE!\" will forever be a classic. This one is not to be missed. Move over, Han Solo....Ford outdoes himself here!","2496":"In this age of terrorism, this is an intensely scary film. Imagine Al-Quada doing what these Russian terrorists do on this plane.  Harrison Ford is good in these types of films and gives a very good performance.  The violence was hard to watch, but it is not difficult to imagine this kind of hatred esprecially from Islamic or other militant and closed-minded terrorist groups.\n\nHang on to your seats, this is a good one.","2498":"I first saw this film on ABC, and I enjoyed it,my little sisters didn't like it very much, but I did,Great Peformance by Harrison Ford. Filled with stunts and action expacially on a plane.","2502":"This film is so over the top it's hilarious, this is POTUS as super hero, you almost wonder why he needs the plane I'm assuming the only reason he didn't reveal his true identity of US PRESIDENT MAN the masked avenger is that he couldn't find a convenient phone booth to change into his star spangled leotard. I enjoyed the film, but I feel a little dash of realism would have made it much better, just a bit believable maybe.","2503":"Spice World, the Spice Girls, need I say more. GIRL POWER! A fun movie for anyone missing the 90's or just looking to reminice.","2504":"I grew up watching this movie everyday on VHS, a complete classic! All music and movie fans should purchase this DVD!","2505":"As a child of the 90's, I couldn't resist adding this to my collection. Yes, the movie didn't win any Oscars but as a Spice Girl fan, what's not to love? It's something to show my 11 year old niece when she tries to tell me One Direction is the best pop teen band to come from England, this movie will set her straight.","2506":"It came right before Christmas. It was a great gift, it was cheap and it came fast. good news all the way!","2514":"The Spice Girls, what more can you say, beautiful, bold, funny, this film is so fun to watch, I love these girls.","2515":"Any die-hard Spice Girl fan must have this item! The video box differs from the main one that was sold at the time of release. *Special Edition*!!!","2520":"Air Force One has been hijacked by terrorists demanding a great deal from the president. they hoped to find him in the plane, but not the way they had hoped. the acting is great in this film by both harrison ford and gary oldman. gary oldman will be the Christopher Lee of the future, always playing the bad guy, but always getting a part in a movie. the most powerful scene in the movie is when the president has to decide on the fate of his family. is national security more important than his own family?","2521":"Edge-Of-Your-Seat excitement! Top-notch special effects! A-level acting! Riveting storytelling! Watch and enjoy! Grade: A+","2523":"After making a speech to the world about a no-tolerence policy againgst terrorism, the president's plane is hijacked by terrorists.  This is an amazing film.  The plot is superb, and the action is great.  Harrison Ford is an astounding actor, and plays a president\/father with super accuracy.  The stunts in this movie are great, including a scene with a refueling tanker, and a scene where the president must ride a tether to get out of the plane.","2524":"I tried to return this item and have to obtain permission from the overseas supplier.  So far it has been over a week and no response.  I thought my daughter would enjoy this movie put she showed no interest and asked me to return it.","2525":"God, i remember growing up with the spice girls when i was much younger. I hadn't listened to their music in a while, and probably hadn't watched the movie in years. It was so great to be able to purchase it (this time on DVD) and relive my childhood. I would definitely recommend this to a friend. A lot of people complain about the plot, and it isn't the best, but if you loved the spice girls you'd love the movie. It's just too bad they had to break up. The spice girls' legacy lives on.","2528":"Spice Girls were HOT. They were FUN. They were GLAMOROUS. This movie is the bomb. You must buy it if you want to see an all sexy European female band.","2530":"This is definitely one of the good ol' us vs. them - good vs. evil story.  Harrison Ford plays a different kind of US President (one that I would like to see in \"real\" life), a President that takes matters into his own hands and deals his own \"justice\" by kicking some serious ... and shooting the heck out of everything.  Good action movie, great for a 4th of July party...","2531":"No one can play a role like this but Harrison Ford. Just another great move in a long line of work!!","2533":"This brings back old school memories that I just can't live without. I own all their music and the collection didn't feel complete without their mini live story. Its a great movie, cheesy  but totally worth it. No DVD collection should be withour a little spice. Fun movie, and it brings out the Spice girl in all of us. Men included.","2535":"This movie is one of my favorite movies, not only because I am a fan of the Spice Girls, but I thought it was fun to watch. I always watched this movie with friends during sleepovers and it was always fun to sing along and repeat all the lines to the movie. Its more of a movie you may enjoy only if you are a fan of the Spice Girls and their music.","2536":"Well, I remember this being my favorite show when I was 11 or 12. Couldn't believe they have this movie on DVD so I had to buy it.  It's pretty much a joke of a movie but because I still have some love for the Spice Girls I was glad I'm able to have this for my collection.  It's one of those movies that you get a bunch of your girlfriends together and remember the hype of the Spice Girl era and have a pretty good laugh.","2539":"I saw this movie when it first came out, and loved it.  I am so excited to find it here.  This movie is not meant to be taken seriously. Basically this movie is about friendship and staying true to yourself.  It is a fun movie that any fan of the Spice Girls will love.","2540":"Who wouldn't want to see 5 sexy girls that sing get involved in an updated version of A Hard Day's Night? C'mon, really now! It's a fun movie and it's about time these girls came back!","2543":"i'll be brief this film is an absolute rollercoaster. people who like SPEED and Gone in 60 seconds should see this movie. I really don't think much of plots but i thought this one was good. You'll enjoy the visual and special effects.","2547":"The worst film I have ever seen.  Absolutely terrible!  You can't care about any of the characters, especially those who are shot within minutes of their first appearance, and the countless explosions and bad one-liners leave you with a headache to beat the band.  After suffering through this dreck, the only thought in your head that is still audible will be, \"Why, Harrison, why?\"","2548":"...because he is one mean-old President when he gets his Irish up! When terrorists take over AirForce One, it's up to the President himself to subdue the enemy. Suspenseful from start to finish, although feminists should take umbrage at the indecisiveness displayed by the female Vice President who's willing to placate the evil-doers. Notwithstanding that, just the kind of patriotic movie to fire up every red-blooded American.","2557":"Harrison Ford brings to life a good presadent traveling on Air Force One that gets highjaked by world terriost and the terroist are seting demands to have a relese of a russin general from jail or he will crash the plane and he kills a hostege every hour.\n  This is a movie that is a must keep.","2559":". . .I liked this one.  Of course this is the president we'd all like to have, a loving father, a stunning fighter, and great one-liners for any life threatening situation.  This movie was suspense from beginning to the end, and chances are you already know that, cause who likes action has seen this film.","2560":"... to be an American! (No matter where you're from.)\nTerrorists hijack Air Force One. Harrison Ford is President. Take it from there.\nA well-paced thriller, with characters - good and bad - having more than one dimension. Moments of ruthless cruelty - and moments of extraordinary courage and valor.","2562":"I love this movie, I'm 23 and was a teen when these girls hit the airwaves, I love them, I love the movie, it's great for teen girls I think (be careful just a little adult humor), buy it!","2563":"I bought this DVD in Oct.\/'05 for someone who ia a fan (!?!).Her B\/day was just last week. She was mortified; I was pissed that even though it was\/STILL IS advertised as 1.85:1 the DIC IS ONLY 1.33:1. i personally don't care but the little girl was shattered. FALSE ADVERTISING!!!!!!\n\nEdd Kerr  iegolden@shaw.ca","2564":"Could it be the worst film ever? Possibly.\n\nCould it be used to extract information from even the most dangerous of spies? Definitely.\n\nSheet torture does not even begin to explain this film. Obviously you should like the Spice Girls if you hope to enjoy this movie, but how can any sane person appericate such a contrived group of utter fakes? Those who are manipulated by our society's every whim, that's who.","2569":"Harrison Ford does a great job in this film. He's so convincing in both emotion and action wise as in his great old movie Indiana Jones!\nAlthough we have seen so many films about airplane accidents and hijacking but this one is a Master Piece of all.\nthe suspense is very original and the action is very entertaining... of course you see that US politics plays a major role in HollyWood!","2571":"I hope they make a sequel so that Harry could go to Mars and get'em all.","2576":"As a 21 year fan & collector of Harrison's, this is him at his best.  Great film.  Which he would do more films like this.  Great disc as well.","2578":"This dvd was below average and we could not even watch the whole thing. It seems totally dated now.","2581":"I like this movie because it was action-packed and suspenseful. At first, I didn't want to see it but my dad made me. I'm glad he did. The DVD version has better sound quality and sharper imaging. I only gave it four stars because, even when the cold war was over, this American-made movie potrayed Russians as terrorizing commies.","2583":"This film is a real dissapointment.  Harrison Ford gives a credible performance as the President and Gary Oldman pulls off his villain role with panache.  But this movie simply doesn't work.  Overall the film is completely illogical and frankly a bit too patriotic, especially for someone who comes from Europe.  Maybe logic isn't exactly what people are looking for when they watch a \"no-brainer\", but this film is really too much.","2585":"Harrison Ford played the role of President of the United States very well.  And he expressed solemnity as the President and humor as Harrison Ford.  The story line is not as simple as it seemed at first sight. It is  elaborated in great detail.  This film is not showy but worthseeing.  Thank  you.","2588":"This is a good movie from start to finish. Harrison Ford plays the hero role to the limit. Gary Oldman plays an absolutely mean and scary villain. He shows no remorse about shooting an unarmed hostage or using violence.  The plot of this movie is outstanding. The idea that these Russian thugs  could use the disguise of journalists was unique. Evev the secret service  agent who goes bad is portrayed as being wormy. The ending makes Harrison  Ford out to be a hero. A very good movie.","2589":"I don't care how cheesy or overly patriotic those cynical reviewers think this movie was. It's good, old-fashioned, edge of your seat entertainment. The president is a decent, moral man who loves his family and takes care of  business in every sense of the word and right now I'd love to see his real  life counterpart in office.","2591":"I am a big fan of Harrison Ford's movies, and Air Force One is no acception. There is tons of action, and the story is great. I honestly couldn't imagine any other actor being able to pull this role off, Harrison  Ford was perfect as the President.","2605":"I hated the Spice Girls before this movie and then I hated them even more after I saw it. Stupid,boring and dull only a child under the age of 10 would like this huge mess.","2611":"This movie sucks, simple as that.  There's no reason to watch and only god know's why it even made a dollar at the box office.  Completely useless.  I would go on, but it upsets me even thinking about that god-awefull movie again.","2613":"Spice world is nothing but a waste of time. I will not reccomend\nit. So go out and do somethingwith your time. Don't watch this\nsuper-stupid movie!","2614":"This movie is a really fun film. Alot of people label it as plain stupid, but I wonder.....WHY CAN'T THEY JUST ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS??? JEEZ, THESE ARE THE SPICE GIRLS!!!!!!!! THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A FUN AND WACKY COMEDY!!! Please, take my advice and give this movie a try. You might just like it.","2615":"If it's not then it's got be be close to it.  This is just horrible!  There is nothing more to say about it.","2619":"Ya, the spice girls aren't nearly as popular as they used to be, ok not at all, but sure ther were when they were around! And so that makes this a pretty good movie since I was a big spice girl fan. These girls are really funny here!","2621":"I admit that this movie was good but it is no \"Hard Days Night\". Spice Girls tried to copy many things that were in HDN, for example, lateness for a concert. They made it seem as if they were trying to do the same thing that the Beatles did over thirty years earlier.","2626":"Spice World is actually a very hilarious film. It makes fun of the Spice Girls and the world they live in. It's also done in the spirit of A Hard Day's Night. Everyone in the film is great, and it's a nice surprise to see  some notable Brits like Elton John and Jennifer Saunders in the film. Don't  take the movie seriously, it's meant to be fun and silly. Also, this is one  of the rare momments you will see Geri Halliwell with the group. It is  definately a guilty pleasure, and fun to watch!","2627":"Although the film is a bit dated, it is worth watching for Kim Basinger's performance as an illiterate bayou girl.  Compare this performance with the super smart callgirl in LA Confidential -- she does have range.\n\nBuy it used at the cheapest price -- you won't be disappointed.","2631":"Great action flick about a cop out for revenge over his partner's death. Fantastic Louisiana swamps, explosive action, cheesy dialogue and of course Kim Basinger getting wet. She was a hottie in this film. Need I say more?","2632":"Good suspense and sexy movie. Kim Basinger added the sexiness.","2633":"The Pre-Katrina scenery of  New Orleans  and of the bayou makes this a worthwhile movie to watch for the aesthetic.  The plot is believable but the chemistry of  Richard Gere and Kim Basinger's connection is a tad odd.  What does occur to me is that Gere's role of saviour to Basinger,  was a glimpse of early Gere activist tendencies.  His role in \"No Mercy\" seems like one he'd enjoy playing.","2634":"Good","2636":"Definitely a film of it's genre. 1986, Miami vice was all the rage, Hunter, etc....\nStars the Handsome, timeless, Richard Gere, a fave since 77's \"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\". The beautiful Kim Basinger as a prostitute, \"Michelle\", from the bayou of Louisana. Not my favorite Gere film. Plenty of action, violence, mild gore , if that's your thing, this Gil right up your alley.","2638":"Good southern style movie","2639":"One of my favorite movies.  Why?  I'm not sure but I do like it.","2640":"good movie","2641":"Good movie.","2642":"great","2643":"DVD arrived in great condition n plays fine.","2644":"Hardcorps Action flick.  Gere is good as a jaded detective looking to get payback for his partner's death.  The final showdown is better than most.  Bassinger is good in this too and works well with Gere in my opinion.  Great escapism.","2645":"Classic Gere tough guy, a cop this time, with Kim Basinger at her steamiest as the love object, and the most love-to-hate bad-guy adversary, played by Jeroen Krabb as \"Losado\"  the Cajun mobster who \"owns\" KB, bought from her mama at age 13 to be his mistress.","2646":"And oldie, but a goodie! I loved this movie years ago and was so happy that I could find it on Amazon. You can't go wrong with Richard Gere!!!","2647":"great movie  to cop in the NOPD station is a charm","2648":"Another Gere and Basinger favorite.  Great movie.","2649":"I worked on this one when it was filmed in Wilmington and Chicago as technical adviser. It was very challenging to Kim to work with Richard, she hated his attitude and showed it off set. But both are great actors in my humble opinion.","2650":"As seeing the title, I expected a really tough action movie but it wasn't.\nIt was a tapid action movie.\nEither actors are not charming enough to rule the running time and the soundtrack was old and just noisy.\nThe chemistry between two actors are almost none.\nI don't know why I spent almost 10$ plus shipping cost for this DVD.\ni feel regret.","2651":"It was a little gloomy, but I liked it anyway.  Richard Gere is one of my favorites.","2652":"good","2654":"This is a great movie in all respects but it is best in its portrayal of the Underworld of New Orleans and its criminals. Also Richard Gere and Kim Basinger were perfect in their rolls as cop and her as the owned woman ot the underworlds boss. A riveting movie from start to finish.","2655":"Love,  Richard. Gere!","2656":"This Is Just A Very Good movie !","2657":"Not a fan of Gere. This by far is his best role. Love this movie. Stemkowski was the best.","2658":"Good movie. These actors are great together","2659":"Good movie.","2660":"2 of the most beautiful people on the planet along with an interesting story - what more can you ask for.  When I'm searching for a new film I'll often say something like 'No Mercy' or 'Basic Instinct'.","2661":"I liked this movie. Basinger is, as always, good at playing what appears to be a weak victim who gains her strength. Gear is good, as usual.","2662":"Great acting, great story line..","2663":"Excellent.","2664":"Ok","2665":"great movie!","2666":"I like this movie.","2667":"wotks fine","2668":"Excellent thriller. Gere still had natural dark hair. Bassinger has never been hotter. Its a good ole boy and swamp thriller.","2669":"Great old flic!","2670":"Great movie!","2671":"Always pleased with anything I buy from Amazon!!","2672":"excellent","2673":"Good movie.","2674":"I first watched this movie when it came out and wanted to see it again. My wife had never see it so it was appropriate for our movie night.","2675":"If you have not seen how gorgeous and beautiful Kim Bassinger is, you should see this movie. Gere is angry through most of the movie trying to find justice for his dead friend and colleague while Bassinger hangs on and follows where he takes her, hoping to survive.\n\nYes, I loved it. But then I love both of them.","2676":"Loved this movie. The chemistry between Gere and Basinger made this movie one of those that you watch again and again!","2677":"One of my favorite 80's films","2678":"An Oldie but a goodie. This is one of those LITTLE MOVIE\"S\"  that the star made. Not his\/her most acclaimed, but one that is truly entertaining and indicative of the talent of the performers and directors. Worth the time.","2679":"Love any Richard Gere movie!","2680":"Great movie","2681":"Besides virtually non-stop action; this old film has a really good cast.  They don't make them like this anymore.  Too bad","2682":"Good 'ol wet fun in the bayou!  And Kim Basinger has the best on screen scream ever.  She screams the same way in the batman movie too.  Hot Hot Hot and filmed in New Orleans and Louisiana.  One for the library.","2683":"still loved it when i was younger at movies still love it as an adult.... must be the chicago side in me...","2684":"No man is worthy of kissing a young hot Kim Bassinger! Lucky Richard! Very suspense filled, edge of the seat drama!","2685":"This is a much appreciated addition to inventory of things that make my life as easy as one would like to have it. As a person who depends a lot on external sources for my professional fulfillment, I am very satisfied.","2686":"great story loved this movie also watched over and over again.  acting is academy award quality highly recommend this movie who loves action","2687":"I've always enjoyed this movie. Good action flick & easy to follow. I thought Kim Bassinger was perfectly cast. I love movies based in New Orleans. It's an oldie but goodie!!","2688":"I really like this movie and I think Richard Gere and Kim Beasinger work will together. Would like to see the in another movie","2689":"Originally had this movie on VHS so I decided to view online, enjoyed it!  Kim Basinger is a very good actress!","2690":"Very good movie.  Richard Gere and Kim Basinger are really good in this movie.  Lots of violence.  So you have to like a  little violence.  I really don't but, this was good.","2691":"TWO GREAT ACTORS THAT TEAMED UP AND MADE A SO SO STORY LINE WORK GREAT. WHO DOSNT LIKE KIM BASSINGER. RICHARD GERE RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BEST OF ACTORS.","2692":"Richard Gere and Kim Bassinger heat up the screen when Gere, a tough Chicago cop, becomes a fish out of water in Cajun country seeking revenge for his slain partner. Definitely worth buying,","2693":"Great movie from 1986, action, romance, crime, revenge, a good bad guy....and a sometimes bad good guy......same thing could be said for the girl........  Enjoyable and worthy to watch again....!","2695":"Good picture and Kim Bassinger is a beautiful woman. The triller is classic and interesting. Picture to remember a Richard Gere young.","2696":"Well written, well scripted, encaptivating and very believable! The acters and actresses deserved awards!! Great Picture. What a shame that so many very good movies from the past will probably never get a chance to be seen because of the lack of exposure and time spent in storage.","2697":"This is simply a great movie. I could stop there, but there is a lot to see and hear in this movie. Kim is beautiful, of course. Gere is a tough guy cop from Chicago taking chances in New Orleans. This movie shows some of the inside society in New Orleans. Be warned: this movie is not for the faint hearted.","2698":"I watch this movie over and over.  I like it because of the intensity between Kim and Richard, and because of the sound track which generates a constant feeling of danger, and because the villian is so good at being bad.","2699":"Did not care for this movie.  The parts of Bassinger and Gere were okay, however I didn't care for the story.","2700":"We had seen this movie years ago and really enjoyed it.  Loved Gere and Basinger together.\nNow years later, same effect.","2701":"A great movie, what one would expect from Gere and Basinger, keeps you on the \"edge of the seat.\"  Lots of suspense and violent action, just the thing for an action \"junkie.\"","2702":"Quality was excellent. Stars are handsome and beautiful. Locations are impressive.  Direction is magical.  Titillating. Download was easy.  I'm  a happy customer.","2703":"I got my movie early and in great shape. I would order from this vendor agian. Thank You and Good Night!","2704":"A glimpse of pre-Katrina New Orleans and its darker side. The stark differences of different places and people all within the USA. Well written and excellent acting.","2707":"We found this movie one of Richard's best. Kim's roll was also one of her best.\nThe plot is unique and well done.

The Blu-ray sounds great!! The video quality does show some less than impressive detail in the scenes while some other scenes display  good colors ! The story is a classic and I will enjoy watching it over again...The movie is provocative and profound. The story still resonates truth about prejudice against people based on their looks in America","2879":"Christmas gift.","2880":"This movie was very nice. However, it was heavy! Heavy in the sense of  getting right to the point of the emotional problems  Of each character. Makes you stop and think!","2881":"So glad to have this movie on blu-ray!!! Very good movie.","2882":"excellent.","2883":"Gift","2884":"Loved this on video - it just as great on DVD","2885":"Like others have said, I've heard a lot about this movie but have never seen it. Well, it was on cable last night and I couldn't make it past the first 35 minutes - quite possibly the worst 'movie' that I've ever seen.\n\nNot the \"dope\" (though they smoke it enough), just dopey beyond words. It is terrible in every production, script, and acting category that you can think of.\n\nThis is the only 'film' I'd rate a zero if I could.","2886":"What can I say, it's a classic.","2887":"A very enjoyable movie of a small town community it which you find a small group of women who  are very fond of each other go through some most dicffult times and happy times together.","2888":"Will make you cry your eyes out but a beautiful story of strong women who bond when times are tough and when tragedy strikes! Very talented cast, a  beautiful story about life, love and all the in-between!","2889":"Great movie!","2890":"Ehhh","2891":"Receive track in excellent condition thanks","2893":"did not care for it, was too drawn out. the only good part was the ending though was sad.","2894":"Classic movie that takes a grainy, hard look at America and the rift between generations.bigotry, racism, experimental drugs and all under a psychedelic blanket of bizarre camera work, scenic views and confusion about what life is meant to be.","2895":"Thanks","2896":"Good","2897":"Didn't think this was the real move because of the case but it is and we love it. Fast delivery great movie","2898":"Love this movie and didn't have in my home collection so I had to add to it.  Great quality and has not given way to being played over and over.","2899":"Brand new in packaging.  Quick shipping.","2900":"FUNNY","2901":"A classic!  My favorite movie ever!","2902":"A classic with an amazing perfromance by Sally Field. Too many classic one liners to count in this chic flic.","2904":"Excellent Product, very satified!!!!","2905":"It was OK","2906":"A+A+A+A+A+ !!!!!","2907":"Very special movie with superior cast.","2908":"Disc was in great condition","2909":"Still wonderful !!!","2910":"This movie is very dated and very odd. But it is very entertaining. I had a copy in the early 90s on VHS that finally wore out for me its one that ill watch once a month or so......Like Tombstone","2911":"Classic CD","2912":"a period piece that showsws history at that time","2913":"Great Movie, but the product description says Language: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), and its not. Its only Dolby 2 channel, not 5.1.","2914":"About relationships, commitment.","2915":"There are plenty of classic moments in this one.  Lots of great characters and solid, life applicable writing.","2916":"Great movie","2917":"Disappointed in the entire movie. I thought I would be watching a classic. I could barely make it through to the end.  The only good part was the few minutes that Jack Nicholson appeared in the film.  Again,  I was very disappointed in this movie.  It was a total waste of money.","2918":"Its an old low budget cult movie............","2919":"good movie.","2920":"Gentle,  interesting film.  Final statement fro Director Peter a bit much,  though.","2921":"A great movie for all genrations.","2922":"The streaming was horrible.","2923":"I needed this version in DVD -- because I wore out the VHS.

Unfortunately she makes me watch it with her all the time. It's a good cast and story!","2927":"Saw it at a theater in Dayton, Ohio when it opened. From South, friends couldn't believe things were that bad. Unfortunately, they have not changed much.","2928":"What's to add to the other reviews?\n\nI remember this movie fondly from the drive-in with my girlfriend & a couple of 6-packs in about 1971. The drug induced scenery in the graveyard is kind of bogus, but it was a low budget film, & most likely different acid. And yes folks, there really were parts of the country exactly as shown in the movie back then... not all in the deep south either.\n\nGlad to find a copy at a real good price. Picture & sound repro. are good.","2929":"Good old movie.","2930":"One of my favorite movies and it gets better and better every time. I LOVE the interplay among the friends who, despite numerous eccentricities, support and care for each other through whatever life decides to throw at them.","2931":"I love this movie!  Wonderful story and cast.","2932":"I enjoy this movie and watch it more than once","2933":"Great Movie, Great Actors!!!\nThank You Amazon for such great \"Prime TIme Videos\"  :)","2935":"Love this movie","2936":"I still like it and i have seen it several times!","2937":"A good return to, \"Back in the day\" when hippies were making a statement in history.","2938":"go for a ride in the 60's...Jack Nicholson wins hearts with his \"Here is the first of the day...\"","2939":"You can't get much better than the stars in this heartfelt, moving and at times very funny movie about friendship and family love.","2940":"Perfect mix of fun and drama.","2941":"Just watched Steel Magnolias for the 387th time. I always hope that if I watch it just one more time, Shelby won't die. She always does. And I always have a good laugh and a good weep in all the same places. Good movie for a lazy Sunday afternoon.","2942":"It's a classic!","2943":"Born to be wild","2944":"It must have been a slow year for movies because I do not see what people saw in this one.  Music, for the most part was good","2945":"I saw this movie when it first came out and I was planning a road trip but this movie changed my mind,","2946":"Mostly like this one for the awesome soundtrack","2947":"Thank You!","2948":"Had to watch a lot of fluff to get to anything with content  Just not my kind of show. Acting was good","2949":"This rocked my world in 1991 during the Gulf War.","2950":"A classic...I love the humor without the need to use vulgarity that constantly seen in many movies today.","2951":"I've seen it many times and loved it.","2952":"A++++++ good movie","2953":"no","2954":"it's easy rider","2955":"I could watch this movie over and over.

A classic!","2959":"Love it","2960":"Wonderful movie adding to my favorites!","2961":"Great actresses!  Great movie!","2962":"Hadn't seen it in about 10 years. One of the movies you can watch over and over. Great family movie.","2963":"The ultimate tearjerker ensemble comedy made for women and gay men, it is very funny and deep. It has some of the best comic lines around that can be easily integrated into fun repartee. It is more important to gay audiences than Sex and the City. A must see.","2965":"good movie","2966":"good movie. Did not like the ending.","2967":"When I saw this in the theater many many  years ago, a redneck leaving at the same time said \"They got what they deserved!\"  That shows how close to reality this movie comes.  Keeps me from ever visiting the South.  \"Save your Dixie Cups: The South Shall Rise Again!\" somebody wrote on the bathroom stall's wall.  Great acting and story.  Too bad the prejudice and racism are still rampant today.","2968":"Loved it.  One of my all time favorite movies.","2969":"I watched this movie because I recently saw Steel Magnolias as a play at a local dinner theatre. The play was better with better and funnier actresses than the movie. The movie was good, especially Julia Roberts, but the play ruined the movie for me.","2970":"Fabulous cast of women and it has a great balance of humor, love, drama, and friendship all rolled up into a good story.","2971":"One of the best movies incorporating the beautiful distinctly differences of a group of women, their lives, trials, triumphs, and how the strength of love and friendship unites them","2972":"Oh I love this movie. I loved the friend dynamics and what it meant to be a friend. Funny that no one had cell phones and life seemed so much less hectic.","2973":"Interesting, but different than I expected.","2974":"The filmwork isn't the best, the plot is thin but if you lived during this era you will be the only one in the room to understand.","2975":"GREEEAT MOVIE!","2976":"EXCELLENT!","2977":"Been a fan of the movie since it first came out. This Criterion edition looks great on my TV screen and sounds great too, even the LPCM mono track!  But the art work, out side and in, is about as plain as Led Zeppelin's choice of clothes for their 02 concert. Tasteless! But then that's been Criterion's tradition. I'd say their worst cover choice was their Gimme Shelter edition.","2978":"Good chick flick","2980":"So many wonderful and talented actresses.  Great story line.  Always there for each other no matter how much they bickered.  Good purchase.","2981":"Very interesting movie.","2982":"A very moving story and friendships.","2983":"Wonderful movie","2984":"I have always loved this movie. Each actress brings so much to make the. Movie perfect","2985":"Great movie!","2986":"Still a classic southern film.","2987":"Great","2989":"Always love a good classic and with clearer picture quality than VHS this is a definite trip down memory lane.","2991":"A classic for my collection.","2992":"Classic!!!!","2993":"Thought it was really cool back in 1969. Still worth a look.","2994":"Made a great gift","2995":"Well I like this movie except for the ending, had to have a copy for myself.","2996":"This film was excellent while the women in the town, all pull together, have fun together and support each other successful.\nIts a WINNER of a movie, but sad while watching Shelby, suffer through her high diabetes attacks and her surgery.","2997":"Fantastic movie.  Classic!  Love, love , love","2998":"Very average and way to sad for me","2999":"This was a great show!","3000":"Great Flick.  Super cast.  Worth seeing again.","3001":"Great cast of female actors. A very touching story about family and friendly relationships. Was not expecting this to be a sad movie, but it shows the ups and downs in people's lives and I was surprised to find out it was sad. Great to see such a nice cast of actresses together. Too bad we don't see many movies with such a great ensemble of great actors.","3002":"Timeless. Simply timeless and perfect. Everything about this movie is wonderful. So many tidbits of dialogue that have become part of every gay man's vernacular. A MUST-SEE!!","3003":"Fun movie.","3004":"Thanks","3005":"Good movie.","3006":"\"Excellent Movie...Love It...\"","3007":"Hey,  what can I say?  This movie is a CLASSIC!  For those who were around in 1969, this movie gave us a glimpse of what movies would become in the future whenever stars like Jack Nicholson and Dennis Hopper get together! A must see!","3008":"Great digital special edition.  Sound , color, everything was over the top.  Really love this movie.","3009":"A golden oldie with a stellar cast.  It still elicits chuckles after all these years.","3010":"love this movie!!! never gets old!","3011":"Takes my husband back to the times he rode his bikes in the early 70s.","3012":"Great movie a true classic,can watch over and over,good sound track","3013":"Every movie buff needs this under their belt.","3014":"Top 100 American Film","3015":"This is a great movie for the whole family to watch.

William","3017":"I quit watching before it was over.  There wasn't enough substance to keep my interest.","3018":"Just love this simple little movie. Something for everyone. Drama. humor, mystery, you pretty much can find it all here. And the acting is all top notch. Great way to spend an afternoon.","3019":"What can you say about Easy Rider except its a major classic? I saw this when it came out while I was in the Army during Vietnam, and it blew my mind. Watch it every once in a while to remind myself there is a lot more to life than my little world.","3020":"It starts off very slowly, and, of course, due to the timeframe when it was made would not be understood by young people today.  I skipped ahead towards the end to see if it would improve before watching the entire movie, and it has a terrible ending, so I didn't watch the whole movie.  It was donated to a thrift store.","3021":"Had to watch for a college research paper assignment.  Would have never watched if not required.  Is considered to be a great movie but I hated it.  The acting is sub par and the hippies are awkward camera tricks are not impressive although maybe for LSD times they were considered cool.","3022":"Epic ,amazing a must see","3023":"This movie has it all, laughter, joy, sadness and tears. It is one of my favorites!","3024":"great movie","3025":"Good.","3026":"I sneaked into a movie theater as a 15-year old to watch this R-rated movie back in 1969. Powerful, great bikes, scenery, slices of life from around the country on their trip. Phil Spector has a cameo early in the film. A timeless classic.","3027":"Really nice movie, highlighting the 'fears' of some.","3028":"great movie.","3029":"Reuired reading for a southerner.","3030":"Timeless movie.  Love Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine in the movie.","3031":"an adult movie in the old sense , that is .no violent action or explosions , just real people interacting.\nI  wish there were more of them made. Needs a sequel !","3032":"Good movie.","3033":"Love this movie. Such an incredible cast.","3034":"Love this movie! Still one of my favorites of all time.","3035":"always good.","3036":"This movie gives you some insight into the 60s.

A great movie by wonderful actors.","3061":"Love the movie","3062":"classic and heartwarming with fantastic actors.","3063":"Another  great movie","3064":"One of my favorite southern gal movies. I am in the south and understand how a southern woman thinks and talks.  Good , funny movie. Even thought the movie pokes fun at God and the young girl who is a Christian and trying to stay faithful to God despite everyone else. In the end she is shown to be more wise than they give her credit. I like that.","3065":"Classic! great soundtrack!","3066":"Great item would recommend it to all.","3067":"Do yourself a favor and don't lose your time with a low quality movie.","3068":"I never was able to watch this movie.

This is like the 5th time I've watched it over the years and it still delivers.","3075":"Classic","3076":"We loved it.","3077":"I  have always loved that film and now I can watch whenever I want","3078":"not up todays standards","3079":"OLD TIME FUN","3080":"I love this movie with Peter Fonda ,Jack Nicholson , and Dennis Hopper---sometimes I  wish I could Ride across the USA","3081":"As a child of the 60s I suppose it's something I have to watch. And it delivers, although the ending is not worthy of the movie.","3082":"Time-bound in style and writing, silly in parts, still an all-time classic for a great cast. All at their best.","3083":"Classic","3084":"Truly 6 star that made this happen. On time","3085":"one of my wife's favorite movies","3086":"Who doesn't like a group of noisy gossipy women.","3087":"Love it","3088":"if your a collector  you will want this; idem. but as far as entertaining.  its actually poorly done","3089":"It's like stepping into a time machine and arriving in America 1969.  Great performances by Fonda, Hopper, and Nicholson.  AWESOME~! soundtrack.  Definitely worth checking out.","3090":"A reminder of what the drug culture is like.","3092":"I have watched this movie several times, it's happy, sad, and hilarious, an all around movie. Kudos to the entire cast.","3093":"Ok for the time and definitely at the top end for the genre. I was disappointed by the ending when it first came out and all these years later it's still a disappointment. There are good scenes in the movie and the cast is excellent. The storyline wanders quite a bit. The sound track is filled with classics of the time.","3094":"Just as I remember. sometimes when you go back to movies you saw as a child they are going to be lack luster, but not this one!","3095":"one of the best movies ever made","3096":"Bored","3097":"A wonderful film that embodies caring, sacrifice and the meaning of true friendship.","3098":"Good","3099":"Great movie","3100":"When I need a good cry this is my \"go to movie\"! I can't  even tell you how many times I've seen it but I  love it!","3102":"Enjoyed watching with my 12 & 14 year old girls.","3103":"It was very good for the time, and it's still entertaining, but not up to standards of the time, although I don't think it would be very successful nowadays.  I loved at the time and I'm happy to have the Blu Ray as a souvenir.  i re-watched it the other day with my friend Peter Stampfel's song in it called \"If Ya Wanna be a Bird.\"","3104":"I never saw this movie when it came out.  It was ok but I was not that impressed.  I remember people talking about this movie but it was not as good as I remember them saying it was.  I might have liked it better back in wilder times.","3106":"Excellent.","3107":"Awesome movie","3108":"Great Stuff. Wish there were some good extras but the picture and the sound are great. They don't make movies like these anymore. Too bad this isn't widely available on blu ray.","3109":"This is one of the best oldies. This is what best friends are for to be there for you at all times. This movies shows that.","3110":"All time classic.","3111":"Love this movie.  I have seen it several times over the years, and always enjoy it.  Life, love, humor, sadness, motherhood, friendship are all covered in this story.  Well acted.  I can recommend it highly.","3112":"Love this movie watch it over and over good movie.","3113":"this movie kills me everytime. one of those movies that can easily keep your attention. i love everything about it!! beware toward the end, if you are a crier, you may be crying for like 15 mins straight haha this movie is so good. a must see. very very good movie!!!","3114":"All time favorite!","3115":"Have seen this movie more than once.  A happy and sad movie based on a mother daughter relationship as told through various holidays and special events.  A must watch.","3116":"I really thought I would enjoy this movie, as I had seen it years ago when I was a pothead,\nBut with all the cussing in it, it was a disappointment.","3117":"good product!","3119":"A","3120":"bad movie","3121":"Takes me back to the era.","3122":"Enjoyable","3123":"good","3124":"Love this movie","3125":"Lots of great characters that really know how to act.","3126":"Great Movie","3127":"A great classic. Good cast.","3128":"k","3129":"Not the classic I thought it would be","3130":"Easy Rider is a very good movie....The soundtrack is great and the story is interesting....","3132":"Excellent and shipped on time.","3133":"Wonderful movie!  A lot of great stars!","3134":"As a touring motorcycle rider back in the 70's I can relate to much of the general atmosphere expressed in this movie.  The music alone is worth it.","3135":"of course","3137":"It is a pretty silly movie, but it is a biker classic, nonetheless....","3138":"It is a beautiful movie.  It shows lots of aspects of life.  Great!!!","3139":"Great","3140":"My favorite movie","3141":"clasic","3142":"delivered on time and as described","3143":"Another One of my all time Fav's, Saw it when it first came out","3144":"Classic that will last for ever.","3145":"Everything looked good thank you","3146":"Classic","3147":"Eden was superb in the lead. She was amazing at conveying both sex appeal and innocence at the same time. The characters on the show are sometimes a little uneven by the way they're written from ep to ep but the talent of the actors overcomes this small fault. I liked the show much better when it switched to color (it was rather dour in black and white). And I like the married Genie stories as much as the eps where's she is single.","3151":"Love this movie, haven't seen it in years. Watched with my daughter this weekend. What a timeless classic.","3152":"This is one of those movies I watch over and over!","3153":"An ageless classic women story! Shirley McClain is hilarious, Sally Field too young to play a mother but so convincing, I can watch this movie over and over again.","3154":"Incredible movie with both sad and funny parts.  The acting is superb!  Love seeing all of these blockbuster actresses together in one film.","3155":"Got it for Father's Day , it's loaded with extras, it's a classic and he loves it. No further explanation for this classic movie that is a part of the pop culture collective conscious. Synopsis: Two men on bikes searching for the American Dream, beautifully shot, great soundtrack. If you haven't seen it buy it now. 10\/10","3156":"a-1","3157":"very happy","3158":"Beautiful Upgrade to High-Definition to a Classic Film.","3159":"I would rate the opening sequence of born to be wild as one of the greatest openings in film  I make sure my system is at full blast. It makes you wanna take out the harley for a ride right away","3160":"A classic if there ever was one. A must see. Love it and very good cast","3161":"I never tire of this movie seen several times . All star cast GREAT CHEMISTRY characters played well to gather sad,funny , quick wit . All in all makings of a great movie. This movie worth the watch and add to your collections of movies .","3162":"Have kleenex ready for this one....","3163":"Good family movie.","3164":"Got it on time,  I am performing this play this Spring and wanted to review the movie.","3165":"Glorious cast and eternal story.  I watch this movie every few years and it never disappoints.  They just don't make movies or actors like this anymore","3166":"As advertised.","3167":"If you like Bikes and 3  famous actors together this is it.","3168":"B movie at its best","3170":"Very emotional portrayal, filmed with the female gender in mind.","3171":"Friends anywhere not only the south","3172":"One of my favorite movies.  Watched it 50 times over the life of the movie.","3173":"Great flick!","3174":"I had this in VHS, so I wanted it on DVD.","3175":"telling all my friends bout this site to get their favorite movies at a great price! I will be using this site again and again!","3176":"This is the blue ray book awesome tells the whole story IF THE SUN well any way that's old Amelia Lousiana this is a real good movie your mom wouldn't let you watch it's good","3177":"I loved this movie when it first came out.  Even though it's dated, it's still fun to watch and reminisce.  \"Roll on Captain America!\"","3178":"BACK IN THE 60'S WE WATCHED MORE MOTORCYCLE MOVIES THAN I CAN REMEMBER. THEY WERE A SIGN OF THE TIMES. MOSTLY VIOLENT AND NOT VERY MEMORABLE. SAVE FOR THIS MOVIE. JACK NICHOLSON WAS A HOOT. PETER FONDA WAS BEAUTIFUL AND DENNIS HOPPER WAS COOL.","3179":"Good storyline, but it's very fluffy. Sally Field does much better acting than Julia Roberts, proving that experience counts. Tom Skerrit's character is a very stupid husband\/father and not realistic at all. It was fun to watch.","3180":"This film was just what I was expecting! I ordered this for an American Popular Culture: The Sixties. Good price with fast shipping.","3181":"I thought it was a excellent movie and very awesome because this is another movie I watched some years ago too,and I think it's still a great oldie but goodie.","3182":"Classic great.","3183":"This is a classic movie, the sound and quality was spot on. I'll watch it again.","3184":"A good movie that I cry every time I watch.","3185":"Great classic from a by gone time, being a motorcycle rider myself It brought back a lot of memories.\nHank","3187":"This is a one of a kind  classic. I saw it in theaters  when it first came out and probably a million times since. I love it","3188":"The kind of movie that takes your memories to days much happier!  It reminds you of how wonderful good friends are and the great values of living in a small town.  It will hold your attention from beginning to end!  It will remind you of how love can hold you and keep you no matter what happens in life!","3189":"Classic","3190":"No comment","3191":"cute","3192":"This has become one of my favorite movies.story line is really good. If anyone likes bike movies they will like this one.","3194":"I really love this  movie the actors and  actress are great my favorite  guy is in the  movie","3195":"VERY  PLEASED  THANKS","3196":"One of my old fav's but it is a tearjerker.  Grab some hankies!","3197":"This is part of my small private collection of watch-again-and-again-and again movies.  Probably once a year on a day I just curl up and watch this.  The female characters in this movie exemplify the best in human character, and the funny parts are funny even when you know they're coming.  All the actors fit right into the skin of their characters.","3198":"Had heard and read references to this movie for years. Was kind'a disappointed . Didn't have much of a story line and I didn't think the acting was all that great. But, that's just me.","3199":"Okay flic if you yourself are a stonner or newage-hippie, but overall I was far from impressed with the quality of its story-line. The ending was even worse. What is the meaning of the whole thing don't go riding in hillbilly hoods, karma, bad things happen to everyone who doesn't obey cookie cutter suburban life, or s*** happens only look out for yourself?","3200":"all time classic  nice bikes  early Jack one-liners  gotta have it in your collection very typical stereo-typed movie about wilder times","3201":"I was fortunate to find this buy. It was always in the above $70 price range but found it for $16.19 one day. The packing was great. I waited for the Blu-ray edition but was disappointed in the quality of the HD. It's better just to buy the DVD version for less.","3203":"This is not a legit Blu Ray release. The picture and sound quality are both very poor. I should have done my research. It seriously looks like some one burned the DVD to a Bluray. VERY DISAPPOINTED.","3204":"This is a very well acted movie too.  I love to watch it often.","3205":"Another favorite movie of mine. The price was right and it arrived quickly.","3206":"Who doesn't love this movie!?\n\nGreat movie at an amazing price. One of those movies that I watch over and over again with my teen girls!","3207":"Best Movie ever","3208":"great movie","3209":"Wonderfull actors.","3210":"This is a great older movie.  I really like the older action movies.  This one is a real classic.  One of the first ones, other than One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest that I remember Jack Nicholson appears in.  Combine that with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper (deceased) you have an excellent movie.","3211":"This movie grew on me.  The more I watched it, the more I fell in love with the characters and dialog.  I am not really a Julia Roberts fan, but this is iconic over the top performance for everyone is a delight.  I really see it more as a Sally Field movie.  You cant take your eyes off her.  I recently had 20 ppl over to my house to watch the movie and served creole food and bleedin armadillo grooms cake.  It was fabulous.","3212":"great movie","3213":"Classic","3214":"Great picture, sound and stream. We had no issues with this movie. This was a classic I had always wanted to see. Loved it.","3215":"the picture quality is amazing on this  bluray disc it is amazing to see all the colors so alive and the soundtrack is awesome","3219":"Glad I purchased this movie - one of my all time favorites.","3220":"Sound on the disk was not good.","3221":"Good.","3222":"This is an upcoming Christmas gift for my grandma. She gave away her VHS copy years back and wanted this again only this time on DVD. I myself have not seen this movie yet but I am planning to do so really soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Peter Smith","3223":"I am very happy with the product and quick delivery.  Thank you.","3224":"great !! fast shipper.","3225":"Can't go wrong with this movie!","3226":"One of the classic movies.  Love it!","3227":"It was an okay film. I not mad that I watched it. I was a little surprised that so many people feel as though it is a classic. I felt that the production value was really kind of low and the editing was terrible. The story was interesting but  enough because it showed a glimpse of what the 60's counter culture was like. And I assume it was accurate because people that spent their formative years in the 60's seem to enjoy this film. Over all I can just say that it was just okay.","3228":"I remember watching this at the drive in when I was a teen.  Thought it was the coolest ever.  Although I still love the premiss of crossing the country on cycles, this seemed like a much better movie in the 60's.","3229":"Takes you back to another time and space. May we neaver forget! Modern motorcycles have nothing on these bikes. We blew it man! What a classic line.","3230":"Used in graduate school for triangulation examples.","3231":"One of the greatest.","3232":"Great buy!","3233":"My parents explained that hippies and others who opposed wars and greed were beaten, killed and otherwise harmed during the 60's. I look around today and see how environmental and anti-war protesters are treated by the police and the surveillance state, and it's still the same. And the rednecks never go away. They just get bigger guns.","3235":"It's what you expect.  Young Jack Nicholson.  Doesn't end well.  Ten more words are required so I'm adding this sentence.","3236":"I loved this movie when it was first released so I thought I would love it again.  It is so dated I don't know that younger people would \"get it\".  Watching it now a good deal of it seemed...well, silly for a lack of a better word.  I am torn between giving it a 2 or a 3 but I had to rate in on my impression now.","3237":"Easy to believe that's the way a lot of people think-if you don't have a special roster your free-and if you're free you're a monster no one likes. A lot of my friends like the end,but I like the rest.","3238":"Great movie","3239":"I gave this as a gift and she loves it","3240":"GREAT","3241":"wonderful movie i really enjoy it","3242":"Loved it","3243":"I loved this movie and it's all star cast.  Have watched it over and over.","3244":"I love this movie saw it first at a drive in and still enjoy watching it!  Great music and beautiful scenery and Jack Nicholson!!!  Nip nip nip...yeah!","3245":"I rewatched this movie again it seems like every 10 years and it does not disappoint. Good character development and interesting turns as you see these men just want to make it to the big party. Jacck Nicholson as the drunk Southern attorney is one of my favorites of his characters. He brings them to life.\n\nSome depiction of standard 60s drug uand alcohol use with brief nudity and violence. Would be rated PG-13 today.","3247":"They say this is a classic. I guess I can see why, but I truly did not like this movie. Way too indie for me. Too many artsy undertones. And it was like one big music video.","3249":"Excellent!!!","3250":"My wife and I love this movie one that we can watch over and over.","3251":"LOVE IT. EVERYTIME I WATCH IT I GET ADDICTED. I AM ALMOST AS BAD AS MY MOTHER.","3252":"Highly Recommend! Fast delivery! Exactly as described!","3253":"great","3255":"This is an all time classic movie from the 60's and early 70's eras. Really nice bikes shown in this movie!","3256":"this movie really gets much more credit than it deserves but does offer some entertainment value.\nhippies and motorcycles never really mixed well and this movie is an example. the saving grace of the music is the music soundtrack. the plot is weak, predictable and as non sensible as the very stoned jack nicholson.","3257":"I don't have too much to say about this movie, mostly because I already wasted too much time simply watching it - I'm not going to waste even more time detailing out the many reasons why I hated it. I just wanted to add my 1-star rating in the hopes of lowering the average. Hopper and Nicholson have performed better on their respective crappers. (I'm not a fan of Fonda's.) This movie was about as bad as watching a stranger's home video of their toddler's first trip to the petting zoo.","3258":"GREAT","3259":"Sometimes you just need that good chick flick.  This movie has so much to offer, fantastic cast, great plot, humor, and saddens.  I think it needs to come with a \"WARNING: BOX OF TISSUES HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\".  If you need a laugh and a VERY good cry, this is one I will recommend any day of the week.","3260":"wonderful movie, never expected it to be as good as it is. wanted a copy for my library","3261":"Good movie.  I like all of the leads, it's a great cast.","3262":"This film brings joy and tears.  ...very moving!","3263":"Excellent","3264":"Loved the pace and the way the director depicted life back then. a lot has changed and they saw the changes. Wish i was born back then.","3265":"Easy Rider attempts to demonstrate the realities of Americans living in America during a very trying time, the Vietnam War.\nFair to say Denis Hopper gets it relatively close!\nThanks to the seller for providing us the product we paid for.","3266":"I bought this movie for a friend who had one too many motorcycle accidents.  He now must just enjoy watching the motorcycle exploits of others and this movie was perfect for him.","3267":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Have it on VHS and have almost worn it out. Wanted it on DVD and am so glad I did. Great movie. Has every emotion you could imagine from happiness, saddness, comedy, etc. If you've never seen it you're in for a treat.","3268":"great work in shipping and product care.","3269":"was very pleased with experience","3270":"Got to go to Nachitoches, Louisiana where this was filmed.  There are pics in the graveyard where that hilarious scene was shot.  Laughing & crying at the same time!","3271":"I have mixed feelings. It's an interesting movie. Positives are beautiful country and good music and some entertaining parts.\nnegatives are nothing really happens. it drags on...","3272":"I was eager to see the movie again but time has not been kind to it.  Jack Nicholson's performance was still great and a lot of fun to watch but his time is brief in the movie.  The sensibility of the movie is not timely but the style in which it is portraited is dated which makes it just okay.  If it wasn't for Jack the movie would not be a classic.","3274":"This film, along with a few others, managed to capture that moment in history when a counter culture emerged during the 1960's and early 1970's.  Needless to say, it made many in the \"Establishment\" nervous.  The drug scene was a bit overblown but the long haired prejudice was all too real.","3276":"Both of my kids love these series of books.  They are at a proper reading level and have great graphic illustration as well.","3278":"Came fast and was as advertised.  It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it.  I would def recommend this classic.","3279":"good movie","3280":"This movie is a classic and will go on for years to come.","3281":"bought this for a gift  for my girlfriend as this is one of her favorite movies it still stands up today and with the extras  it was an incredible buy","3282":"I bought this as a gift for my mom and step-dad.  Neither of them had seen it before.  We are all from the south and I knew that they would see so much in this movie that reminded them of our younger days in the old south.  They both loved it and laughed hysterically when they told me how much they enjoyed watching it.  Another great product at a great price.","3283":"Another one of those movies that just makes you feel good with a great cast and wonderful storyline. Another one to add to my classics collection I will cherish it always!","3284":"I absolutely love steel magnolias!  I couldn't find this movie anywhere on DVD and I ordered it ASAP after seeing it on amazon  This is an amazing movie and is a chick flick for sure, but my boyfriend even loves it!  Lol","3285":"I saw the play for this and it was great! The movie was a disappointment for me. The story line was not as touching as it should have been. It was not believable.","3287":"This was a \"movie night\" special from my dad. Definitely not a let down. It's nice watching older movies, sometimes, because the style is so much different than what we get nowadays.","3288":"A dated movie from the late sixties. The acting was poor and not well written as well as produce. Save your money.","3290":"Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda, and more star in what is considered to be the best biker movie ever made. People still talk about this when talking about biker culture. Classic Sons of Anarchy(FX television series) for classic movie fans!","3292":"What kind of capitalist plot is that?  Guess I'll wait for it to come around to pay-cable again!\nBTW, the scene where they can't get a room at a motel?  It's not because they were long-haired hippy bikers, but because they were F**ING rude!","3293":"This movie is simply stunning. An awesome commentary on the world in the 60's and very expertly shot. Don't pass this one up.","3294":"I just love WEAZER!  This is one of my favorite movies and I remember watching it a lot with my mom.  I finally have a DVD of it and will always cherish it.  Just a great entertaining movie!","3295":"I love the actors in this movie.  This movie is a timeless classic that I repeat from time to time.","3296":"1989 saw the release of Steel Magnolias, which I was lucky enough to see in the theatre. Dolly Parton, and Sally Field head a cast who play southern women in a small town. Sally Field is tremendous in the cemetary scene. The film makes some very pointed remarks about life not only in the south, but everywhere.","3297":"Live this movie","3298":"love it .. and watch this movie all the time.. very heart warming and reminds me of family that i miss","3299":"Has always been one of my favorite movies to re-watch & so ordered it so it would always be available to me.  Great price!","3300":"I loved the cast members and this original will always be my favorite.  Shirley McClain was really funny and can play any role.","3301":"Academy award Winners Sally Field,Dolly Parton,Shirley Maclaine,Julia Roberts,Olympia Dukaksis and Daryl Hannah star as southern women dealing with Diaylsis and life's situation's. Parton won the People Choice Award Best Actress. Roberts Won the Best Supporting Actress Golden Globe, lost the Oscar. All the ladies have Oscar's and Nominations except Hannah. Parton steals the movie as Truvy","3302":"I bought this DVD for a friend of mine, and she loves this movie. It's been on TV quite a bit lately, but nothing is better than being able to put the movie on pause, because of having to get more popcorn! I gave this movie to my friend for her birthday, and I know she has watched it 3 times already. It's a great chick flick.","3303":"A classic movie with a classic story.  I've seen it many time and just decieded to buy so I can watch it when I want.  If you're a youngster, you need to do a little history lesson to understand it.","3304":"I was too young when it was released to understand and appreciate. Now I took the time to order it and I fully grasp it. It is sad but things have not changed so much in some places in America, tolerance-wise. Saw it after viewing the Wild Angels, with Fonda too.","3307":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. This film has virtually no story just some guys ride motorcycles and then get shot. If you like movies with completley irrelavent scenes that are inconsequential, this a movie for you.","3308":"Put Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper and Jack Nicholson together and you have an iconic film about the crash landing that was the end of the Sixties in America.  The making-of documentary included in this disc is an absolute must after seeing the film - the insight you get into how it was put together is both funny and amazing.  I can see how this may appeal more to Baby Boomers than those born after 1970, but everyone should enjoy Easy Rider.  The ending is powerful and makes a lasting impact.","3312":"Saw this in the theatre in 1969.\nThe girl I saw it with later broke my heart!\nBut I still love the film!\nA truly original and revolutionary film!\nOne of the best ever!","3313":"I had forgotten how sad this movie is.  Still funny and memorable with great performances from all involved.  Must see ... again.","3315":"This was one of my favorites. Excellent cast. Played so well together. Sad ending. Would love to see a part 2.","3316":"Tells a story of friendship ..they share their lives which includes the good and bad times ..laughter, sadness, heartache, but \"thru thick and thin\" ...if we work together ...i.e. as a team ...there is more fun, special memories, hugs,  just \"love your neighbor as yourself\"  ...the Golden Rule ...,,","3317":"A great movie with a lot of great actresses. So many different personalities in the movie characters that just blend so well.","3318":"Overrated,boring and long,It stars Two Pseudo-Commie And Poseur Actors:Fonda and Nicholson(Hopper is good though).\nThe movie does not represent True Bikers. Bikers Are not Hippies,They Are Tough,they were TRUE Counter-Culture,Realists And Reactionary like myself. Sure There are bad apples and racists, but it isn't liberal fascist like most hippies. The best Biker Film is Hells Angels 69' and it actually has them in it!","3324":"The entire cast did commendable work in bringing the audience an example of a family and a community which has developed strong, loving, supportive relationships.  Those relationships allow the members of the community to share the joys of each others' successses and handle with grace the pain of their losses.","3325":"excellent cast - great acting - great story line\none of my top ten movies of all time\nhave some tissues handy","3326":"Definitely a woman's movie. Sally Fields, Dollie Parton, Shirley MacLaine and Olympia Dukakis are real close friends.  They portray southern woman. The story is their life story,  Julia Roberts plays Sally Fields daughter and Daryl Hannah is a hair dresser.  There is so much to this movie. Funny, sad and a good movie for the girls to bring out the tissues. Great story and great actresses.","3328":"American dreams\nDrugs, cash, girls -- an endless highway\nIt's true, we blew it","3329":"The Bottom Line:\n\nA deserved classic, Easy Rider functions so well as a capsule of its time that it should be used in history classes; that said, it's also a nearly-great motion picture that admittedly lags a bit in its first half hour but hits the ground running once Jack Nicholson comes aboard and never stops for breath.","3330":"good.","3332":"I first saw this movie on the Bravo Television Network and loved it immediately, so I searched for it on Amazon.com and bought it at a very reasonable price. It's a great family movie for one those \"movie-night-ins.\"","3333":"This movie has endured as a classic from the day it was first released and couldn't have been more perfectly cast. MacLaine and Dukakis are priceless! I've seen this movie so many times that each actors lines are committed to memory, yet I watch it again and again.","3334":"Excellent movie. Best yet.  Have always loved movies and music. This is the best!\nThanks You always for giving me this.","3335":"I LOVE this movie.  It has an all-star cast.  It has drama, comedy, sadness and good stuff.  I enjoy watching it over and over and over.  Who wouldn't love a movie that had Dolly Parton, Sally Field, Julia Roberts, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley MacLaine AND Daryl Hannah in it.  I already have this movie in VHS, but I wanted it also in DVD.  I have watched it MANY times and LOVED it EVERY time!!!!","3336":"Still timeless after all these years.  Shirley Maclaine and Dolly Parton at their finest.  Ad it to your collection please.","3337":"I love this movie.  So many great actresses all in one place.  Sally field looks so young!  Everyone should see this film!","3342":"This movie has everything in it. You'll laugh and you will cry. Its about these women that do nothing but talk about each other, They seem to meet at the beauty shop all the time. Julia Roberts plays a girl that has some type of illness. You will end up laughing at some of the tings that these woman do.","3343":"For some reason, wives love this movie, and it puts them in a good mood.  Very nostalgic for the oldies but goodies.","3346":"This is a great movie with a sad ending (very rare), I`ve seen this movie almost 10 years ago, and I was shocked with this ending, and now that I can see it again, it happens the same, but I think that the speech of Nicholson about freedom is timeless, I mean, you can apply it now, in few words, this is a movie to have it in your dvd player, and the soundtrack is fantastic, but its dissapointing that only have 8 songs","3347":"Jack Nicholson and the great soundtrack are really the only interesting or entertaining aspects of this film. I found myself fighting the urge to sleep, which was especially annoying after reading over and over again for years about what a classic, epochal movie ER was. If you want excitement, great story and script, great acting danger and an even better soundtrack from the same era, go for Performance or Get Carter. Avoid this snore.","3350":"I really like movies that are true to life and this movie was.  It held my interest, and the actors are really good.  The ending was sad, but it was all in all a really good movie.  This is a family movie.","3351":"This has always been one of my favorite movies.  An all star cast and rich characters.  The fact it is a true story and filmed in the town being written about made it even more interesting.","3352":"This is a good movie for women.  It stirs every emotion.  The friendships between these women are inspiring.  I've watched it a few times over the years and have enjoyed it every time.","3357":"I just love the way these women ban together thru thick and thin, I have a friend like that and when I miss her I w","3358":"had it on vsh before, had to have it on dvd! Julia Roberts is extremely great! WOULD BUY IT AGAIN","3359":"I love this movie and rate it as one of the best of all movies.  Whenever I feel down this movie always pulls me out of it.  Dolly Parton is a National Treasure in my book.","3360":"A classic amazing film with both unforgettiable comedy and drama. Dolly Parton, Sally Field and Julia Roberts really pull off the classic act. The film is both very funny but also very touching as you see how strong women really are. Its a classic and a must have for all women.","3361":"Even after so many years have past since this movie came out it still an amazing movie to make you laugh, cry and appreciate life.","3362":"I can't pass this movie by if it's on cable or regular TV, and I'm glad I was able to watch it streaming on Amazon.","3363":"This movie includes one of the best casts you could ever assemble.  No matter how many times I watch this, I cry buckets. The story is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and sacrifice.  I highly recommend to everyone!","3364":"Could write a college paper on the meaning of this film; but would like to leave it up to the view to view and consider for themselves.  What do the characters and their actions signify.  Some are obvious, but those are just clues to view the whole film as a metaphor for American Society.  The thesis of the film is around the camp fire spoken by Jack Nicholson.  Sorry if I've said too much.","3368":"What a cast!  This movie has a little bit of everything, comedy, drama, tragedy, not to mention these wonderfully strong and funny best friends who will do anything for one another.  By the way guys, not just a chick flick, you'll like it too.","3369":"I don't care how old this movie is it's one of my favorites. It's a great mother-daughter flick like Terms of Endearment. Great actress Sally Fields, Julia Roberts, and the rest of the ladies.","3370":"Great movie. I watch over and over again and still love it. Heartwarming movie about how important family really is.","3371":"I can't say enough good about this movie.  I love it.  I've seen it many times and I always get lost in the story and the lives of those incredibly funny and fully realized women.","3372":"this is a great family movie that tells how life really is ,and how family still are willing to help each other when it is necessary","3373":"The acting done by all cast members is wonderful and this is one of my all time favorite films & always will be.","3376":"Well, it may have been representative of its day, but as of 12\/27\/05, it's grown pretty tedious.  It has one thing to say, that could be said in about 10 minutes, but it spreads the \"message\" out over way too long. The ending is truly shocking, and somewhat redeems the tedium of the earlier parts of the film that tend to drag, drag, drag.  Jack Nicholson is, of course, the bright spot in the film, but he's in waaaaay to little of it.","3378":"Steel Magnolias is something I cannot deny enjoy watching.\nFor some reason it just gets my heart melting and my\ntears flowing. I will warn it may not be everyone. It does\nhave its moments of quirky woman talk, drama, and it has\na bitter sweet ending. It is also aimed for women who love drama so\nkeep that in mind and hope you enjoy it.","3379":"I loved the actors and the movie characters. Most memorable scene is the funeral in which the ladies share their feelings in a very sad situation","3380":"I love this movie and has such a great story. This has such great actors. I watch this movie every few months.","3381":"I'm a sucker for movies like this. What an amazing cast although Dukakis and McLaine outshines them. The movie is a decent adaptation of the play.","3382":"I co-worker once quipped that this movie was just a \"woman movie.\" She seemed to have some disdain for that. It's too bad she marginalized it in that way because this is a fantastic movie about the love of friends. Just look at the cast, and you know it's going to be good.","3384":"Note my use of \"actress\" as oppose to \"actor\" for a group of supremely talented ladies.  They are ladies and sisters and mothers and aunts, etc. and deserve to be recognized for excellence in their gender which is at very least equal to the opposite gender.  Political correctness in retitling jobs\/careers is so inane and to me detracts from this wonderful motion picture as well as from women in general!","3385":"Replacing my VHS with dvd's and this is a  family favorite.  Funny yet still can watch with little ones about.  Great family movie and great actors.","3386":"My mother loves tearjerkers.  This movie definitely qualifies.  She was thrilled to get it as a gift.  This movie has some classic ladies in it as well a very young Julia Roberts.  The Southern ladies in this film are pretty true to life.","3387":"I want to see Queen Latifa's version of this.\n\nI liked this, but having the one set, and no men, tells us more about the women. Seeing M'Lynn in the hospital with her daughter makes the impact of her telling her story to her friends much less.","3388":"What's not to love?  It has everything from mothers\/daughters to female friendships, life in general, marriage, the whole banana.  This is my favorite movie when I don't feel so well or down in the dumps and it always saves the day.  It's a great ensemble that you can tell enjoyed working together.  Love it!","3389":"There are no easy riders, for we all die the death at the hands of the living.  But it is the night Lords who give everlasting undeadness, and prolonged existence.  This movie fails to show that in it's hunt for freedom.  Fools.  There is no freedom in the day.  IT IS IN THE NIGHT!!!  Their deaths lead to nothing but repugnance of the living.  Join us, oh seekers of the easy rider.  We fly, and nightcrawl.  Leave your helmuts behind.","3393":"One of the best movies ever made! The characters evolve through several years but the love and friendship never fails.","3394":"These classic films with young and rising stars and seasoned powerhouses are not made as much these days.  Such a shame to not allow more of films like this to see the light of day.\n\nLoved it....More than my luggage","3395":"So many good actors portraying classic characters of the time, generation and style of the South.  Keep hankies nearby even when you've seen it several times!","3396":"I love this movie everytime I watched it.  Had to give it another review this year. All the characters are really deep and you feel that you know them.","3397":"This is a great movie filled with tears and tons of laughter! I've always loved this flick since I first saw it in the theater. Yes, it's a chick-flick but it's a good movie for all.","3398":"Funny and touching.  Sally Field is a great actress and is supported by a fantastic cast.  An older movie worth the watch.","3399":"have seen it a million times, but it is always a treat to watch.  this is a look into the lives of a few women who are friends in the same southern town.  the cast is awesome, so is the dialogue.  this will both make you laugh and cry several times.  there are a few hard scenes towards the end, but the movie ends in a way that makes you feel good.","3401":"I love this movie!  I've seen it 100 times and plan on watching it 100 times more!  One of the best movies ever made!","3402":"every time this movie was on television i would watch it and when i heard Queen Latifah was going to do a remake i was excited until i actually saw it.  Needless to say the original is way better, and shows more emotion; really the funniest actress in this movie is Shirley MacLaine.","3403":"I'm so glad I watched this movie. From beginning to end, it had my attention. These female characters are strong Southern women who navigate the trials of their lives well. It's rare for a movie to have so many female characters that are not steriotypes or bad role models for girls. I would definitely watch this movie again.","3408":"About the 10th time my wife and I have seen this since theatrical release. It's a wonderful feel good movie with a sad ending sort of like \"Bambi\" and \"Old Yeller.\"","3409":"This is a great movie dominated by great actresses. I love this movie, a true chic flick. If you need a good laugh or cry this is the movie to see.","3410":"This is a classic good hearted movie. Great cast. I can watch it over and over again. A good family movie.","3411":"some days are just made for watching steel magnolias it is a get the girls togather with a tissue and a bowl of popcorn or watch alone for some laughs and tears we are all steel magnolias chick flick","3412":"Finally got around to seeing this...\nMeh. It was okay. Considering the buzz from female\nfriends and family members, I was expecting more.\nIt holds up well as a film from the eighties, but not entirely for me.","3413":"Steel Magnolia is one of my favorite movies.  Every time I watch it I end up crying at the end!","3414":"This movie is a strong one that pulls on your heart strings. You'll laugh a lot, cry a little, and love it all the more. While the ending might be sad it also leaves on a cheerful note (oh, you'll see). Really this is a movie meant for a girl's night in with bons bons and wine.","3415":"This film has every aspect to rate it a 5.\n\nThe actors are first class; the story well written;\nthe scenery perfect with music beautifully supportive of the action.\nYou will laugh, cry, and see this as a story that could be true to life\nwith its sorrows and joys...courage, pathos, friendship and love...","3424":"Real friends through thick and thin, not always agreeing, not always fighting but learning together and working their way through life's joys and sadness.","3425":"This is one of those movies that will always make me cry at some point. I love a story that involves a few main characters and follows them for a span of time. And some of these characters are just amazing. The characters are funny, crusty, fanatical, and even a martyr type. This story hits a lot of highs and lows of \"real life\" situations. I watch it about once a year anymore. *S*","3426":"I enjoyed this DVD which  I couldn't find at my local Walmart or Target,\nWhile on vacation we thought of Amazon and two day delivery.\nWe checked it out...Amazon had th film and it arrived two days later in the mail.\n\nMy grams daughters and I finally got to see the movie together.\nWe really enjoyed it.","3429":"bought for my mom. she has Alzheimer's and is really enjoying watching the old classic movies! hj kjh jklj lkjl","3433":"How to make a movie with almost no money ? Watch Easy Rider ! It's a terrific journey ! The story is simple but the actors (if they really are ;) are really fantastic. The Nicholson performance is unforgettable. EASY RIDER is a CULT movie and it still explains very well how the US society was in the 70's. Try to get the 30th anniversary remastered version including a very funny retrospective documentary to better understand the whole concept of Easy Rider. A once in a life !","3436":"I loved this movie the first time I watched and every other time since!  It's a sweet movie.  The actors are awesome!","3437":"This movie will make you laugh a great many times, and it may even make you cry a time or two. The casting was great and these awesome performers definitely deliver performances to be proud of.","3438":"This has been my favorite movie from the first time I saw it. I had it recorded, but switched service providers, so I lost it. I can't live without the funeral scene, so I had to purchase it for my Kindle Fire. A loved one passed away recently and this scene has always given me comfort for some reason.","3439":"I've seen this movie so many times I've lost count, anyways its a good movie to watch over and over  because it's funny and sad at the same time but this movie makes you feel happy, well to me because it brings back good memories of the time my mama kept telling me of her southern childhood, how happy she was and much fun she had with her mama !!!! it's worth buying!!!","3440":"What can be said this is one of those movies that you just sit back and say this could be my family...just because of the antics of the family.....","3441":"I have always loved this movie!  Being a southern girl myself, some of the phrases and genuflections really hit home.","3442":"A goodie\/oldie movie. A sad but lovely story, One of my top faves!!!!!! Amazing movie. Great cast, too. I have always loved this one.","3443":"Yup - I love this movie and getting the special edition at a good price was like frosting on the cake.","3449":"this is a film I never miss on t.v. so I got my own and love it more with each viewing... Never mind \"chick flick\" this is for everyone...","3450":"I absolutely loved this movie when I saw it for the first time in the theatre.  Each of the actors portrayed in this move did a superb job.  I have added this movie to my movie collection!","3451":"There are so many one-liners in this movie that THAT is reason enough to watch it.  This is one of the best \"ensemble\" casts ever and this movie will go down in history as a class act.  My daughters grew up with this and THEY love the movie as much as I do...we recite one-liners to each other all the time and it never fails to make us laugh.  I definitely get the same feeling from others which says a lot about the movie!","3452":"Loved this flick, got it for a girls' dorm and it's checked out all the time. Movie nights galore with this one.","3453":"The DVD arrived before the estimated date in perfect condition. I loved this movie when I was a teenager  and I still love it today. I remember watching it with a couple of my girlfriends and relating to the closeness of the characters. Watching it again brought back great memories. Love it! Would recommend it it to anyone who likes a good,funny,real,tearjerker!","3460":"Love this movie and love this vendor. Got it for a good price and I will continue to use this vendor for future purchases.","3461":"Finally found this on DVD!  I looked everywhere for this movie and finally found it on here.  A classic that is a must have!","3462":"I think this is a good movie for ladies.  It has a lot of different emotions in it...sad, happy, funny, etc.","3463":"This purchase was great and the service was excellent, as always. I am very pleased. Fast service and exactaly what I expected.","3464":"It was super awesome to get the product as fast as I did. I appreciated so much. thanks again Carlena","3465":"This is such a classic! im sure if your reading this review, you've seen this movie! I just think the cast is stellar, and to see all that big hair!! Dolly looks the about the same now as she did then, well except her face is a little more pulled back, and she's a bit more \"enhanced\" up top. Enjoy this great performance by some of Americas finest actresses","3468":"A somewhat interesting movie due to the time period this movie was filmed. Basically, this movie was nothing special and pretty much like a million other movies out there.\nThe movie is totally overrated mostly due to the cast, Fonda, Hopper, and Jack Nicolas.","3471":"I can't acknowledge my admiration of this movie enough.  To me this is American Cinema at its finest.\nIf you like stories about freedom this is for you.  To paraphrase Jack Nicholson 'Lots of people like to talk about freedom but they don't want anybody living it'.  Its a sometimes surreal adventure, but it makes its points well.\nThe wide screen version enhances the, already superb, cinematography.\nI give this film my highest recomendation.","3475":"I received the product even faster than expected, the price was excellent and the product is just as described, great!","3476":"This cast is awesome! I love this movie! One of my favorites! Julia Robert's performance is incredible! I have seen this movie so many times I can quote it.. which is probably why I can't get anybody to watch it with me!\n\nMust have for any fan!!","3477":"this is the movie that made julia roberts career and what a great movie,  offers so much  it is so funny and will make you cry  this is a movie i watch from time to time and it never gets old  one of the best movies ever and such a great cast  no one else could have played any of the roles","3478":"A true American original about Southern folk and how they react to both the good times and the bad.  An excellent cast!","3479":"great movie shirley maclaine dose a great job as dose the all star cast it makes you cry and laugh","3480":"This is a wonderul cast. Story line is good. Lots of laughter and tears at times. Highly recommended for any movie lovers collection!!","3481":"This is a all star cast, these lady's bring a smile or laugh to every ones face, this is a must see family movie","3482":"I love this movie so much!! I am grateful that it showed up in time for the holidays with my family...because I know we watched it at least 5 times in a week! Thanks for being fast!!","3486":"I think the copy I had before our home burned down was VHS but it MIGHT have been a DVD. so glad to be able to watch it again and not have to deal with frequent commercials. An all-star cast about strong women supporting one another. Some might call it a \"chick-flick\" but my husband never complains when it is on. Thank you Amazon; it arrived 4 Jan 2013.","3487":"dated, but stil a great chic flic to watch with your girlfriends on a chilly winter night. Makes you laugh and it makes you cry. the best kind of movie.","3488":"this movie was amazing i love it, it has made me cry and laugh so hard and it also has a life lesion in it i would highly sugest this movie.","3489":"We love watching this movie at home.  It never gets old and I can't wait to watch it over and over again.","3492":"I loved this movie, happy and sad all in one, the bickering between the women was the best part of this movie for me","3493":"A movie to be watched over and over again. I'm glad to have this movie in my collection again. I am pleased to say the DVD condition was good and it worked well.","3494":"Steel Magnolias is the old south no longer there. These women were typical southern belles who love each other and bond as a community. This is a great movie for families but PG","3495":"Classic movie - great lines and many famous actors and actresses- Oliva dukacus is very good and so is McClaine","3496":"I really like this movie its sweet I like Dolly and Julia Roberts its sad at times but a really good movie.","3497":"Another wonderful movie about relationships. I can't understand those who who don't agree this is a 5 star movie but each one has his or her perspective. I think this movie is as good as any other out there. - so well acted, written, directed, photographed, etc.","3498":"i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easy","3499":"I was too young to watch it first time round. I watched it twice this weeek on dvd, and am sort of hooked on it. It has the same effect on me as 9 1\/2 weeks. Weird scenes, great music, and adventerous. I liked Fonda. It  makes you want to hire a Harley and blow a small fortune for a month in the  west. The ending was terrible. What is the point they were trying to make  with this ending ?","3500":"Great Biker Film.  Peter Fonda and Dennis Hooper are just to cool for words.  Jack Nicholson works great a comedy relief.","3501":"Wow this is an old favorite movie of mine. All the actresses are super performers and this movie is one that will make you laugh and then make you cry. It is a good one for sure and I recommend this movie to all who love the actresses playing a part in it.\nThumbs up!!","3502":"This was actually a replacement.  I loaned out the copy I had owned for quite some time.  It was definately a must replace for our library, a long standing favorite in our home.  Amazon offered a great price as usual.  It arrived on great condition, also as usual.","3506":"This is a total girlfriend movie.  These southern ladies each have a story to tell and they all run together when tragedy strikes when one of the charachters.  Just goes to show that you us girls can be a lot stronger than you think.  Lots of laughter, tears, one-liners and an all around enjoyable flick!","3507":"Outstanding performances by several well known actors\/actresses.  This movie has a great story line that I can never get tired of.  Kind of a feel good, comedy, chick flick combined.","3508":"It's one of the greatest movies ever made. I worked security on the movie, and got me meet some of the stars. This is one of the best films Dolly Pardon ever made. It worth the money.","3510":"Will this movie ever stop being funny? It's so wonderful and entertaining, with such a great cast of ladies. Dolly Parton and Shirley MacLaine were my two favorite of them all. It's about a woman choosing between life and death in order to have a child no thanks to her diabetes. But she has her mother and friends to help along the way. It's touching and really well done. One of the best films out there.\nIt's interesting how this film is so funny with such a depressing storyline......","3512":"I love this movie, It's such a classic. I can watch this movie over and over again. I even know the lines to the movie.","3514":"This is a great movie in that it is jammed with great actors and any movie that you are laughing one minute and crying the next is a winner to me!","3515":"Great deal on a fantastic movie! Great shipping. No problems. This is how service online should be! :)","3519":"This is my favorite movie that has Dolly and Julia. I love Julia and Dolly both - but to have them together in one is even better! I also love Sally Field - second best actress. I am speechless. ALl I have to say is this is the most wonderful review ever.","3521":"Very good product in VHS. However buyers beware of this title in DVD. I purchased 2 from different sellers and the sound was missing on both.","3522":"After many years, I watched this film again a couple of days ago. It continues to be a touching and great women's story. Whenever it came to my mind, I remembered Sally Field's performance as Shelby's mother, M'Lynn, always  giving love and support to her daughter even against her will and mother's feelings. All actresses were great, but my favourite charater will be always Sally Field's.","3525":"I absolutely love this movie. It has everything a movie should have...memorable characters, comedy, drama, romance, etc. It brings out almost every emotion. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Be prepared to cry at the end though, Sally Field gave an excellent performance.","3527":"Tear Jerker! Sally Field never fails to deliver a phenomenal performance! The cast of actors worked well together. The movie left you wanting more.","3528":"Never fails... as many times that I have watched this movie, I always cry at some point.  The friendship these ladies share and the southern ambiance is great!","3529":"Steel Magnolias is one of my very favorite movies.  I am replacing my VHS tapes with DVDs and it was one of the first ones I replaced.  I love the special edition DVD because it told the story of the writer's sister who died young.  It gives the movie even more special meaning knowing that it's based on a real life situation rather than one that's completely fictitious.  Five Stars!","3532":"This movie will become one of the all time favorites you can watch and enjoy every time.","3533":"LOVE Shirley McClain and Olympia Dukakis is a RIOT!  If you loved Terms of Endearment, this is one for you.","3534":"It's funny, it's sad, it has everything that most women can associate with.  It is one of my very favorite movies and I've watched it at least 10 times.  Shirley McClain is hysterical.","3536":"Academy-Award winner Sally Field (\"Norma Rae,\" \"Places In The Heart\"), singer Dolly Parton (who co-wrote the hit \"I Will Always Love You\" with Whitney Houston), Daryl Hannah (\"Kill Bill,\" \"A Walk To Remember\"), Academy-Award winner Shirley Maclaine (\"Terms Of Endearment\") and a young Julia Roberts (long before her win for Best Actress in \"Erin Brockovich\") highlight this entertaining film based on a play. I love this film. Rated PG for mild language and some thematic elements.","3537":"I don't expect anything more of a movie than to enjoy it and be entertained. I don't seek to psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique, it's only a movie. I either enjoy it or I don't. This movie is priceless, MacLaine & Dukakis are exceptional. Field can still make me cry. EVERY time.","3538":"B+ movie. Rated PG for some language,mature thamatic material involving life and death,and nudity. Canada:PG.Good for ages 9 and up.","3540":"Like an old friend, this movie always brings laugh, love and tears.  It is a great mix of comedy and drama and the performances are first rate.  I saw it in theaters in 1989 and as a gay man, just coming out, it was real comfort food.  Always five stars for this movie!  I'd give it six if I could :)","3543":"For years I had seen this movie on department store shelves and toyed with the idea of buying it, mostly for the array of actresses in it I recognized. For one reason or another, though, I never actually saw this movie until it was on TV a few days ago. And did it ever impress me. The characters are so real, the beauty so intensely beautiful, and the tragedy so unbearably sad as to instantly make it one of my favorite movies of all time.","3544":"Steel Magnolias is a movie that is timeless.  You cannot beat it.  I know I am in a minority in saying that it is better than Terms of Endearment and Fried Green Tomatoes but in my opinion it really is.  The love between the characters is more real and heartfelt and isn't as dismal to watch as in the previous two films.  The acting is awesome, as well as the score and plot.  The movie will rip your heart out.  I highly reccomend it.","3549":"i like this movie alot except for julia roberts. i don't understand why they chose her to star in a movie called \"pretty woman\". they should have called it \"ugly horseface\". anyway, steel magnolia's made me laugh alot and then it's sad sometimes - kinda like drinking everyday! shirley mccaline was really good too but i don't think the role was much of a stretch. olympia dukakis scares me. sally field looks mean. and that girl from splash is always a hoot. but let's not forget dolly. remember the dollymo!","3557":"Good Movie but this one is definitly for girls only because it has no action and Guys will probably find it boring.  Anyways I liked the movie and being a girl I loved this movie.  It had great one liners and had many wonderful stars in it such as Julia Roberts and Sally Field.  This movie released in 1989 shows it's age somewhat but will always remain a classic.  This is a must have for girls only.","3564":"Hey i'm a guy.  And guess what... I loved Thelma and Louise, A Leaugue of their own, The Color Purple, Somewhere in Time... and I could go on but why.\nI saw absolutely nothing and I do mean nothing special about this film.  I just don't get it.","3567":"The first time that I saw this, I really thought that Shelby (Julia Roberts) was a spoiled and inconsiderate brat. HOwever, after watching this movie ten times, I realized that I was wrong. she wanted a baby SO much. Julia Roberts played Shelby so well. I think that she got an Oscar nomination for this movie.","3568":"This is a wonderful, witty, family tale about friendship, compassion, and moving on. Several months after I saw this film, a friend of mine passed  from diabetic complications arising after her third child. She almost  looked like Julia Robert's sister. It was a terrorfying event that one so  young could go. In this film, the mourning scene will forever be etched in  my mind. Humor is a spiritual Kevlar, folks. Do your spirit a favor, see  this movie, over and over.","3574":"I have seen this movie over 10 times and I enjoy it every time I watch it.  Julia Roberts, Sally Field, Dolly Partin, Olympia Dukakis, Shirley McClain, and Daryl Hannah give stellar perfomances.  It is not a  fast-paced, full of action movie, but a slower, interesting movie about the  lives of six Southern women.","3577":"All three versions of the classic movie, plus lots of extras.","3578":"Fabulous movie.  Just as exciting as it was when it first came out.","3579":"Very pleased with this purchase","3580":"The first time watching the movie is ok.  Not that good each time after.","3581":"A favorite movie of mine. I grew up with it. For better or worse, movies like this and ET made me mistrustful of the government at a very early age. The adult me can also relate to the story which involves a man who abandons his loud kids and nagging wife to fly away away (to who knows where?) with a bunch of aliens. Oh, and it looks good in HD too.","3583":"nan","3584":"Somewhat corny at times.  Does not hold up to 80's\/90's flics.","3585":"Everyone should see this movie.","3586":"....never did care for the tall alien that got out of the spaceship, but I still love the movie. This is a classic from start to finish. Not the greatest in terms of acting in some of the scenes, but there is just something about this flick that really sucks you in. Give it a watch...........","3587":"It was better than 2001 A Space Odyssey, but it still stunk.","3588":"a little long, and dated, but still wonderful!!","3589":"The original +5, Buy it if you feel strongly about it and for sentimental reasons or it you know someone who has never seen it. Youngsters anyone?","3591":"When I was younger this movie was amazing. The effects were mind blowing. They simply don't hold up. Sitting through this again I realized that almost nothing actually happens and the spectacle of space ships and aliens doesn't really drive much action or story, basically only some conflict with the wife. The aliens play some tones and have all the effect on the planet of a man leaving the toilet seat up.","3592":"Just as good today as it was in the '70s!","3593":"Classic movie, great movie!","3594":"Only good thing was the musical conversation. The rest SUCKED and made me sad.","3596":"As all ways one of the best movies of all time","3597":"This was scarily accurate, I would know, I've seen real life aliens.","3598":"EVERY bit as dazzling (AND moving) today as it was for those who saw it back in 1978; just wish Spielberg would write MORE SCREENPLAYS, since he's ever bit as terrific doing THAT as he is DIRECTING. A+++++","3599":"Good acting, and there's some suspenseful parts that keep you on the edge of your seat, but overall I wasn't impressed. I didn't even finish watching this movie. I only watched about half of it, then turned it off because I was getting so bored. Would not recommend.","3600":"One of the only alien movies out there that depicts ETs as kind, empathetic beings. Terrific! None of that hokey sci fi horror, monster-type crap. Well done and intriguing story line.  Could watch it over and over again.","3601":"Still lots of fun. Holds up fairly well.","3603":"Great movie.","3605":"Yep, I'm a SciFi geek, it's a Classic and so am I...","3606":"terrible...absolutely terrible, there are 3 disc's....the first one is the original, B.S. @ 15 min., dad shows son math problem by using a toy train set- not this one, only a train wreck....@ 30 min.,scene shifts to the desert where a ship has been found- not this one; disc 3 is the directors cut, it shows these 2 scenes but also cuts out a couple parts from the original.....had I known this, I wouldn't have bought it...don't waste your money on this one","3607":"Bought this to replace my old worn out VHS copy. Great plot and acting. They should do a \"Return of Close Encounters.","3608":"Classic! You are a moron if you think this movie isn't good. Richard Dreyfuss rocked this movie and I suggest anyone into Science Fiction should watch this movie at least once every couple of years. Your kids and grand kids should even watch this film! Excellent graphics and very well done.","3610":"My favorite movie of all-time.","3611":"Still one of the best movies of it's time","3612":"Classic movie, recommended!!!!","3613":"This is a rare classic indeed, everyone should get this one!","3614":"one of my top 5 movies - never get tired of watching it!","3615":"Great!!!!!","3616":"The perfect guide to an alien visitation.","3617":"Wasen't what I espected.","3618":"Great Movie!!","3619":"awesome","3620":"this is one of my top five favorite movies of all time.  The visual effects were groundbreaking for their day and still hold up well over 30 years later.  I particularly enjoyed Richard Dreyfus's acting as he accurately conveys the peculiar sense of urgency that motivates his character.","3621":"What a great movie of all times.","3622":"One of my new favorites!","3623":"One of my all time favorites","3624":"FANTASTIC PRODUCT, THANKS.","3626":"A classic","3627":"nearly 40 yers old and still a great movie","3628":"Classic Steven Spielberg...the development of Richard Dreyfess as a major acting star combined with the advancements special effects in this film was an insight into the future of the film industry for years to come.","3629":"What can I say? It's one of my favorites.","3630":"Love love love this movie.  This is basic Spielberg and very watchable.","3631":"A must see!","3633":"great movie for Halloween Party on the out door projector","3634":"Classic Spielberg.","3635":"My family thoroughly enjoyed this classic!  Close Encounters now\nhas a new generation of fans!  I recommend this product for purchase!","3637":"It was fun seeing the movie again.  We made it a point to see it after our trip to South Dakota where we stopped to see Devils Tower.","3638":"Still awesome after all these years.\nSure the SFX look dated, they were obviously optical not today's CGI but still great.\nAnd it's neat to see how the world (at least the US) has progressed in thinking on such topics about thirty years (wow!) later.","3639":"Great Directing.","3640":"The classic first alien movie by Steven Spielberg. Although the effects may seem a little outdated and slow, the acting is what has always made this movie great, and Richard Dreyfuss is superb as the father who loses his family and thinks he's losing his mind because he saw UFOs and is driven beyond all reason to discover what is happening to him and others who shared the same experience.\n\nOne of the best movies made in this lifetime.","3641":"Always loved this movie.","3642":"Thank You!","3643":"Great movie. One of the best in its time.","3644":"Very Fun Film. very intense.","3645":"Love it","3646":"Classic!! A must see to any sci-fi lover.","3647":"A great film about first contact with alien life.  I watched recently with my family.  It had been quite a few years since I last saw it.  Interesting to see technology in 1977 - no internet, no cell phones, etc.  That stuck out for my kids, but they were definitely engaged for the whole film.","3648":"This movie is great!!!! I saw many times through my life, and i still think is a masterpiece!!!! Well, Spielberg got many masterpieces, and this is his 2nd, right after JAWS!!!! If you like Sci Fi stuff, you just got to see this one!!!!","3649":"Best Sci Film about UFO encounters.","3651":"The special effects are amazing!! Defiantly worth watching! And you do not have to be old to enjoy this film, I am 18 and it is one of my favorites.\nIf aliens exist or not. After seeing this movie it really makes wonder if such beings are out there... Anyways. If you LOOK closely on the mother-ship (In the movie) you can see R2-D2. If you can not spot him, you probably can see a video on Youtube that will show a close up","3652":"Epic!!!","3653":"A classic!","3654":"Excellent storyline  and special effects. My favorite movie in the entire universe!","3656":"I saw this when I was little and didn't quite get it, so I did a re-watch for old times sake and it was great.  Richard Dreyfus was a hunk...lol\nTotally recommend this movie for all ages","3657":"LOVE THE POSTER THAT COMES WITH IT, TOO!","3658":"This is truly a classic movie and should be in everyone's sci-fi collection.","3659":"One of the few movies I have seen that makes a virtue of the term, \"blockbuster\". Left me with a sense of awe and wonder. And even today, it excites me to watch it. Fun!","3660":"While the movie plot was still a classic \"good story\", I was seriously unimpressed with the film's print qualty. This is billed as an HD copy,  with no obvious work done to it. Still as a Spielberg product,  it is not to be missed. Buy the Blu-ray for $10- 15....!","3661":"Classic movie at a great price. 30th Anniversary Edition. High quality and a great addition to video library.","3662":"Great movie.","3663":"Very dramatic. If you love sci-fi, this is for you.","3664":"Classic","3665":"great sci-fi movie","3666":"YAY CLOSE ENCOUNTERS!!! (still waiting for mine!!).","3667":"Great story. Unique concept. Perfectly fitting acting. Great direction. Intelligently entertaining.","3668":"First things first. I am not an S.S. fan. It's Dryphus who made it worth watching.","3669":"If you haven't see this, you should.","3670":"Another Sci-Fi classic for your Blu-ray collection. Still holds up today. I will never look at my mashed potatoes the same way again.","3671":"If you have not seen this epic science fiction event please don't tell anyone. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Richard Dreyfuss. Music by John Williams is superb.","3672":"Amazing, life changing the first time I saw it.  One of my favorite Spielberg movies","3673":"Classic movie. Still great after all of these years.","3674":"Well, what can I say.  A classic for sure.  At the time of its release it created quite a stir, and although some aspects may seem a little bit dated today, it is very effective storytelling.","3675":"Love this movie so much","3676":"Love that movie!","3677":"watched and thoroughly enjoyed it","3678":"Easily in my top 10 of sci-fi movies. I rewatch this movie quite often. Great story telling. Aside from being a great sci-fi movie at the time it is remarkably accurate in how someone's life might unfold should something like this really happen.  I am always shocked at the family reaction early in the film. It's very intense and well played out. One of the great movies to remember.","3679":"Good","3680":"good","3681":"Great quality from Amazon streaming. Genius movie, has always been a favorite and has gotten better with age - originality like this doesn't exist anymore.","3682":"Love this movie.","3684":"I saw this movie when it first came out, so it was a treat to see it again.  My mom came along with me, and she loved it.","3685":"Fabulous movie and happy to have it in our film library.","3686":"A timeless classic. First time watching in HD was very cool !","3687":"Ttally great, exciting, suspenseful, funny in parts, and the beginning of a genre.","3688":"good","3689":"Cd was in great Condition","3690":"Thank you, Amazon, for having this movie.  So happy to finally add this to our DVD collection.  One of our favorite movies of all time.","3691":"Classic","3692":"The melody is stuck in my head","3693":"I love this movie and will watch it many times into the future","3694":"Good movie for the 1970\"s I always wanted to see this movie. after visiting Devils Tower in WY this summer I decided to watch it.\nThanks for having it available Amazon","3695":"Comes with the poster. A book full of pictures and info, cast and crew, 3 versions the theatrical, the extended and the directors cut.  Special features including a glimpse inside the mother ship.  What is it about Stephen Speilberg that can give you the same sense of wonder at 36 that you had as a child.","3696":"Of course another one of Steve Spielberg's classics.  I remember seeing first when it was in a theater and later on TV.. Just had to a have it for my collection.","3697":"This is one of those movies you never get tired of watching. I've only watched the original, but I will get around to the other versions one of these days.","3698":"Timeless!","3699":"classic Spielberg","3700":"great movie","3701":"Great!","3702":"A CLASSIC MOVIE!!! It was great to watch it again!","3703":"A classic!","3704":"Great movie if you love UFO and Richard Dreyfus  you will love this movie. Funny and great. Have a great night in with your loved ones and watch this movie it's Great. Sign  Kathy","3705":"Exactly what I wanted...delivered the exact arranged day! Thank you!","3706":"Great show","3707":"I forgot how entertaining this film was.","3708":"Love the hidden messages and references to true events.","3709":"A classic.  No further explanation necessary!","3710":"Spielberg from 1977 and still a classic","3711":"Great product good price, very happy with purchase!","3712":"thanks my friends","3713":"Excellent!","3714":"This is the one you want, if you want to buy this movie! It has all the versions and added bonus'. The interviews and behind the scenes are spectacular!","3715":"Great!!","3716":"well done","3717":"Effects are a bit basic by today's standards but a great emotional move full of suspense.  I enjoyed it as a teenager. I watched it last month prompted by our visit to Devil's Tower in Wyoming.","3718":"It's a great movie and it was fun sharing it with my son, but the picture quality left something to be desiredThe 5 stars are because Amazon, of their own accord, recognized the problem and gave me a refund for the rental price.  Thank you so much Amazon.com!","3720":"An amazing movie. Highly recommend.","3721":"Excellent classic.  A staple in your movie collection.","3722":"Would give it ten stars!  There's a version of this movie that is filled with tons of extraneous garbage but this one is NOT that version.  Great, cohesive storytelling and impressive visual effects that actually have a purpose rather than being a gee-whiz distraction.  Don't rent this, BUY it.  You'll watch it over and over.","3723":"This was a requested gift.","3724":"original story...!! great movie","3725":"Wonderful movie!!","3726":"Incredible movie!","3727":"Wish they made a 3D version! SciFi with honest possibilities.","3728":"Wonderful Spielberg film.  A classic that stands the test of time","3729":"One of the great benevolent e.t. films.  The plot and special effects remain surprisingly fresh today.  We are encouraged to view e.t. contact responses from both military and civilian perspectives.  Pay close attention to the strategically placed \"big foot\" testimony witness which disrupts a potentially productive e.t. press conference.","3730":"I Like It","3731":"Excellent.","3732":"Classic childhood movie","3733":"Classic!","3734":"As expected.  Very Nice.","3735":"Really great movie but too long.","3736":"Devils Tower, Aliens and Spielberg!","3737":"this is a good movie. i am glad i got it.","3738":"Great movie!","3740":"A classic top performer from Steven Spielberg","3741":"Great classic!","3742":"!!! Just perfect !!!. Thanks a lot.","3743":"always liked this movie, was nice to see it again and have it in my collection.","3744":"Good movie.","3745":"People see lights in the sky in Indiana and develop a need to draw\/sculpt a mountain. A child gets abducted. Electricity is affected. Then people go to Wyoming. The last 25 percent of the movie is people standing around saying little and looking at space ships. Visually pleasing but short on explaining.","3746":"July 4th film, ET fireworks.\nPotatoes.\nChicken wire.\n\nAnnoying ET theme music.\n\nClassic sci-fi sun burn.","3747":"speilburghs epic sifi  masterpiece is greatly restored and its epic cinematogrophy and enjoying scens are even more enjoyed now more than ever","3748":"GREAT MOVIE!","3749":"Suspenseful and a great ending. Dreyfus does a great job.","3750":"Good classic if you like classic movies.  Otherwise it's ok.","3751":"Even today, it is a great movie.","3752":"A classic. Haven't seen it in decades and it still holds up as an engaging cinematic story.","3753":"I just love this anniversary issue. The packaging came cracked, but nothing too severe.","3754":"Thank you","3755":"Good Movie! Fun to watch before heading off to see Devil's Tower!","3756":"What a movie!!!!","3757":"works good.  bought it to replace lost CD to the library","3758":"Just a great movie - even after all these years!","3759":"Super Fast Shipping - Item Just as Described - Recommended Seller 5 stars*****","3760":"A little silly by today's standards.","3761":"I remember seeing this when DRIVE IN's were still a thing.. curled up in the back of my fathers AMC EAGLE Wagon.. figured i would watch it again.. was instantly annoyed by the constant screaming of everyone in the film and the kids.  Cant believe I liked it as a kid!","3762":"Always there is time for this one....a classic.","3763":"Incredibly well done classic movie. Easily one of my favorites of all time.","3764":"One of the best cinema movies ever. A must own","3765":"Great film.","3766":"This is my ALL TIME FAVORITE movie! Steven Spielberg's finest movie EVER!","3767":"Thank you","3769":"Like the move but didn't mean to buy it. I had one touch buying set up and accidentally clicked on the wrong key.","3770":"Excellent movie to watch over and over again","3771":"Excellent condition! Thanks","3772":"A great  movey and terific directing","3773":"Ground breaking effects and narrative of its time. Exceptional, acting.","3774":"Excellent service and merchandise.","3775":"I love this version better than special edition or directors cut. The 135 minute version is the best and I still love the theatrical version better","3776":"Sill one of the most compelling movies dealing the topic ever to be made. The cameo appearance of my old mentor, J. Allen Hynek, still thrills me each time I view it and the feelings I experience while watching the \"visitation\" and fly over scenes bring back memories of the real thing for me. A brilliant, compassionate, funny and compelling film.","3777":"Interesting movie.  Kept my interest throughout.  Would watch again.","3778":"A Classic for all times.  One of the Best movies ever made.  Steven Spielberg\nis a Master of Film Making.","3779":"What's not to like","3780":"Good mivie","3781":"Are you kidding me? Its Close Encounters of the Third Kind in HD!! Quit reading these reviews and go rent or buy it already! Your wasting time!","3782":"good","3783":"probe me","3784":"Rated everything with stars rating but don't have time or inclination to write extensive reviews... Sorry....  Google \"immigration gumballs\" to see why millions of illegal latinos in America damages our society and infrastructure while not benefiting their nations of origin.","3785":"GREAT COLLECTOR'S SET!!!  Great movie.  You've got to have this!!","3786":"Just rating, not reviewing.","3787":"Liked it so much I bought it...acting and storyline well done.","3788":"Bought as a gift for an elderly person who loves sci-fi movies.","3790":"fun and exciting a great roller coaster ride of a movie, i love sifi and this is a good one.","3791":"Quick response - thanks!","3792":"Great classic that never gets dull watching over and over.  Richard Dreyfuss is awesome just like in Jaws.  The UFOs flying through the sky looked real. I liked the background plot to hide the existence from the public, something that the government is capable of doing for cover-up.  No complaints, too bad it was fictional.","3793":"Love this movie.  I tend to like the version that I saw in the theater in the 70's.  I never really cared for the re-releases, but of course they are interesting to watch.  The video and audio of this release is outstanding.","3794":"I enjoy this film and so I had to upgrade eventually to Blu-ray.\nNothing more to say really other than that it looks and sounds wonderful on Blu-ray.\n\nSo, enjoy! :)","3795":"great picture great sound good special features","3796":"Finally I own it . I love this movie. Probably a top 10 of all time","3797":"WHAT A CLASSIC.  NEVER GETS OLD.","3798":"This was a gift for my wife's niece who came to visit us in NE Wyoming, after we took her to see \"Devils Tower\" (she's from the Seattle area).We live about 40 miles from \"Devils Tower\", where they filmed the close encounter scenes in the movie. This is a true classic Steven Spielberg's  film, and she loved it, especially after visiting the tower.","3799":"great","3800":"Just what was wanted,and fast delivery.","3801":"Great movie","3802":"This is a great Scifi movie. Spilberg rises to the top","3803":"So glad to be able to get this on DVD as my VHS tapes began to fade and snap.","3804":"Fun to see the ships, thanks","3805":"A blast from the past! Awesome!!!","3806":"Close Encounters is an oldie.  I did not know they made 3 different versions until I got this anniversary version. It has 3 discs--not just 1.  It's great to see what the Director's Cut put in and left out from  the theatre version.  This is much better than just ordering one version of this great old movie.","3807":"Classic!","3808":"Loved it when it originally came out, loved it even more now.  The extras were fascinating.  Holds up very well after 30+ years.","3809":"I had no idea this had all 3 versions of the movie!  A great deal for a timeless movie.","3810":"Alien classic","3812":"I saw ufos back in Clinton, Iowa in 66 and when I see them in this movie it sends the same chills down my spine.","3813":"I never saw the movie in a theater so I cant say how it originally looked, but this 30th anniversary ultimate edition Blu-ray is great, although there is some graininess in parts of the movie, it is the best I've ever seen it look, and you get 3 versions of the film, all good. the special features disk is not Blu-ray, but who cares.","3814":"A one of a kind masterpiece.  Everything believable.","3815":"One of my all time favorite films. Spielberg drew the content from many actual UFO reports. Allen J Hynek, no doubt, served in some capacity as an adviser... he makes a cameo at the end. I gave it 4 of 5 stars, because it is a bit dated, and the end scene is not as stunning as I recalled. Never the less, a classic SCI FI film.","3816":"saw this many years ago, had to see all the versions...","3817":"Fun movie. Watched it in Wyoming near Devil's Tower, so really cool.","3818":"Wow - this movie has aged badly, very, very, very badly.  SS is not that great a director at all...yuck.","3819":"Love Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. It is my second favorite movie next to Star Wars(all 6 movies). I highly recommend this to anyone who believes in UFOS. If you don't believe in UFOS this movie might change your mind.","3820":"Classic now dated in impact. But you gotta watch it. I enjoyed it.","3821":"I bought this on DVD because I have it on VCR & couldn't imagine not having it in my movie library.  The movie was magical when I first saw it & it doesn't lose its magic with repetition.  It's a classic great movie.","3822":"WENT FROM RENTAL TO OWNERSHIP OF THIS MOVIE","3823":"This is one great movie, and it always has been.  You follow Richard Dreyfuss' obsession from one stage to the next, even to the loss of his family over it.  You see the events leading up to the grand finale where they pull out all the stops.  It was, is, and ever shall be one of the movies that set the bar for this genre of stories.  It was great then and it's great now.  You won't be sorry you added it to your collection, I gar-on-tee!","3824":"Beautiful and almost as impressive on a smaller screen as it was in theaters when it first came out. This one will never get old. Fast shipping, perfect as described. Thanks.","3826":"A blast from my past, and a great example of how movies can tell stories that awe instead of simply shock.  Pitch-perfect cast and film-making.","3827":"Great","3828":"The special effects in this movie are awesome, especially considering the time it was made, they are still fantastic! I enjoyed watching this with my kids for the first time, and look forward to watching it with my grand kids when they are old enough. I'm always surprised if someone say they haven't watched, I tell them they are deprived and need to watch it soon! Yes this movie is highly recommended!","3830":"A great film and a classic one at that.  Even though the film was made several years ago...it still stands as an icon to all things\nSpace.  Dreyfuss as always, commands the screen with humor and awe.  A sequel should be made that the spaceship comes\nback to our Earth...in the decade of 2000 +","3831":"I got this as a present, but I don't really like it. I know others have loved it, but I couldn't get into it.","3832":"Always great to see the scene shots and filming locations done by Spielberg. This movie embodies his talents in the likes of E.T. and 1941. Great acting and extra scene shots not shown in the original film release.  Richard Dreyfuss never disappoints. Great supporting cast of actors.  Now if only we can all use our smart phones these days with cameras for more opportunities to collect  UFO photos.....hey wait, why doesn't that actually happen?","3834":"I must not have read the description well enough when I purchased it. I was expecting a new dvd in a simple new dvd case. Instead I recieved an amazing collectors box! I knew the dvd was special edition, but this was amazing! Perfect condition, hard case box and art, all dvds were impeccable!  Im so happy w this purchase! It was a gift for my mom, and she loved it too! Now we're enjoying watching all the different versions!","3835":"1977 saw the release of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre. Once you see it, you'll never forget it. For it's time the special effects were awesome.","3836":"You already know the movie but if haven't seen it on Blu-ray, you don't know what you're missing, it is spectacular! Picture and sounds is first rate and includes the extended director's cut too. You don't want to miss this one!","3837":"Yes, I replaced my VHS copy with this DVD.  Its a great movie that I watch from time to time.","3838":"There are 3 different cuts of the film including the original theater release and Spielberg's director's cut. There are also several other features and an interview with Spielberg. You can't get immersed in the movie over several days and see what differences the cuts make to the impact and pacing of the movie.","3839":"If you like this movie, this is the collection for you. You get all 3 versions plus great bonus features and quality packaging. Essential Sci-Fi viewing!","3841":"One of my favorite movies, if you have a great connection and hdtv, get the HD, its totally worth it. I felt I was going to be abducted a few times!","3842":"I enjoyed watching it again all these years later. The extras made it even more interesting. Hearing the creators talk about selecting the sites and actors was interesting.","3843":"nice paging  and nice to see old things look new and stylish.  Brings back my childhood.  Worth the money.  good deal","3844":"\"YOU'RE ABOUT TEN SECONDS FROM DEATH!!!!\"  Now I just have to watch \"Batteries not Included and I'll have my fill of aliens for the day.","3846":"Good to watch again, especially since I don't believe I had ever seen it from the very beginning. Liked seeing all the old things from my childhood. DVD  itself was great since in Blue Ray.","3847":"Favorite all-time movie.  we Can watch for hours and hours.  Love the music, scenery and acting.  Richard Dryfuss is great.","3848":"Always been a Spielberg fan so I thought I'd pick this up. I bought the two-disc collector's edition knowing I'd love this movie so I'd want more... and I did want more! I bought it used to and it looked perfectly new. Great movie. Highly recommended.","3849":"Good movie, but it is a bit slow towards the end. Difficult to understand for an 8 year old. Thanks","3850":"Excellent","3852":"This is one of Spielberg's best movies.  It has a great cast and is beautifully filmed at Devil's Tower in Wyoming.","3853":"Even after all these years, I still enjoy this movie. It has great characters, a good plot, a good cast, and the more educated I've become more educated about the reality of the world of ETs and UFOs, I've come to understand that it also has a lot of truth to it.","3854":"Enjoyed the movie but a lot has changed since this came out. I heard that it is being refilmed and updated which should be great using today's technology.  I hope they include Richard Dreyfus in the new version because he us a fantastic actor and really made thus version of the film the classic that it is.","3856":"...to get all three releases in one package like this.  I've watched two of the three, haven't seen the Director's cut yet but am looking forward to it when I get the chance.","3859":"Enjoyed.  Have heard about this for years so it was great to find it on Amazon.  My first intro to Amazon and I was pleasantly surprised .","3860":"This is a terrific older movie with a great  plot .  I had seen it years ago and wanted to be able to watch it again.  I really enjoyed it.  The packaging and arrival times were well done and expedient.","3861":"Great film about encounters with aliens and how a few people seem to be chosen by them and their struggles to connect.","3862":"I have never understood what people saw in this nonsense. Richard Dreyfuss portrays a complete ass who abandons his family on an idiotic whim - this is a hero? What does he accomplish? Nothing. The movie is well filmed and produced but to me it is like covering an aging hooker with makeup and pretending you have anything other than an old hooker.","3863":"This is a great blast from the past. They don't make movies like this anymore. Share with  your kids and grandkids!","3864":"This is a great sci-fi movie. There are actual UFO experts who have roles in this film and it makes it all the more believable. Great movie!","3866":"I've been converting my VHS collection to DVD & of course this one was on the keep list.  DVD arrived quickly & in great shape.","3867":"This is truly a Bench-Mark for Aliens come to Earth Science Fiction.\nWith the other entire extreme (aliens are here to eat us, aliens are here for our water, air, women, . . .) available for viewing, this is a refreshing look at another point of view. Also, having the Original-Theatrical, the Special-Edition and the Directors-Cut just makes it better; whether you are into nostalgia, or getting to see it at fully blown-away proportions.","3869":"I love this film--why its (in blue ray form) extremely brilliant in display--sound is bar non.well written and well acted one of the best FX spetaculars  ever made","3871":"Great classic sci-fi I enjoyed as a kid and it still captivates my attention to this day.  Steven Spielberg always seems to show the lighter side or more benevolent side of alien encounters which I enjoy.","3872":"I've been watching Close Encounters for a long time in theaters and at home on video tape, but this full HD Blueray presents a spectacular picture!","3874":"There was 3rd encounters. A playful yet sometimes psychotic look at a group of humans encountering extraterrestrials. They make contact, they communicate and the return some people they borrowed.","3875":"For being such an old movie, it still stands up to modern movies of this genre, as do the special f\/x. One of the best UFO movies ever made. Bought it during the Christmas sale for $15. Watch it!","3876":"This movie is a cult classic for sure, but not my cup of tea. Fortunately it was only a gift for someone else since I like watching movies that have a lot more engaging material and dialogue than this one.","3877":"I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility.  It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition.  She loves the movie.","3878":"Classic. Corny at times. But  you can't go wrong with Spielberg. Fun and colorful. Government still does the same things.","3880":"A classic movie by a legendary director. You can it watch over and over again and be pulled in by the story telling and the acting each time you see it.","3881":"Long-time favorite movie.  Gotta love it in Blu-Ray.  Real classic.  Fun to see the dated parts, but still holds up as a great movie.","3882":"Was so glad to get this as it is hard to find in stores. I love watching this movie never get tired of it. Dvd was in great shape, excellent price and fast delivery. I soon as I got it, broke out popcorn settled down for night and enjoy.","3883":"I am not a alien's among us freak. I love this movie because the combination of acting and storytelling were equal to the special effects of our time. We live in an age of where poor story telling is allowed because the special effects are so good people don't complain: especially when it comes to SyFy...Saaaaad. but you will enjoy this film as its true value is the storytelling and not the subject matter.","3884":"This is a great deal to get the anniversary blue ray discs at this price. If you are the ultimate sy-fy addict like myself you will love it, Came with nice little booklet the size of a DVD case. What can I say but da-da-dah---dah--dah","3885":"Was hoping for a substantial Picture quality increase over the standard special edition DVD. Only marginal improvement during the outdoor scenes. 5 stars for all 3 versions being available on one Disc. 3 stars for the pic quality.","3886":"Terrific movie! Big fan of steven and his work. This was a very exciting and interesting movie! Its classic sci fi and i love it, also has some great acting","3887":"I saw this movie in parts when it first came out but not until now have I seen all the movie entirely.\nI got the edition with the theater , directors cut and another different disc.  Haven't seen all the discs yet but enjoyed the one I saw.  Looking forward to the others.","3888":"Great movie with awesome video and audio transfered to bluray...completely awesome. 30 years later and still one of the best movies to watch. It will never get old. Definitely a most own movie for movie lovers.","3889":"This movie is a classic - and really was a trail blazer with regard to alien theme movies. It is a movie that continues to be thoroughly enjoyable.","3890":"great special effects. I think that was what hooked me. I first saw this at the theater and it had extra footage in with the movie not as extras.the story wasn't spectacular but it did the job. I think this was one of steven speilbergs best movies","3891":"For those who love si fi movies, this is one of them that I enjoyed watching on Tv and being that this is going to be a gift to an elderly couple, I am sure they too will enjoy it.","3892":"this is one of the most famous alien movies ever made.  Richard Dreyfus is the main person and he has a close Encounter of a space ship that changes every thing.  i love the whole movie.","3894":"This is a science fiction story about a disparate group of people who attempt to contact aliens. The group includes electrical lineman Roy Neary (Richard Dreyfuss), single mother Jillian whose son disappeared while a UFO was in the area, and a French researcher who thinks we can use music to communicate with aliens. They all meet up at Devil's Tower, Wyoming.","3895":"I remember watching this when I was younger--and my husband had never seen it.  It was just as good as I remember it, and the scene with Barry being abducted still creeped me out (my husband agreed it was intense).  We enjoyed watching it together, and it will be something we will definitely watch again.  And my husband agrees that it's important NOT to trust the aliens...regardless of what happened. :-)","3898":"This is one of my husbands favorite movies. So when I seen this on amazon I just had to get it. I am very glad I did,he really likes it and I also enjoyed it. It was a great price also.","3901":"A very good cut! It is a good movie anyway and I think the quality is better then the original and of course more scenes!! This was a very popular movie in the 70's and I think it is still good today!-Garry Hixon on Steven Spielberg.","3904":"This is a stunning movie, the extras are good as you learn how it was made, the politics Spielberg had to endure with the studio and how (and why) he hired certain actors for the parts.\n\nJust to clear up on this DVD set, it includes the original theatrical version, the ultimate version and the directors cut version.","3906":"This bluray edition of the package is the one to get as it has all 3 versions of the film (theatrical, TV release version, and the Spielberg preferred director's cut along with a very informative \"poster\" where the movie flow timelines for all 3 versions are shown and compared.  It is great to see and hear Spielberg (both then and now) and appreciate what a creative genius he is.  The bluray presents a great picture and the sound stage is as immersive as I remember it when I saw this movie as a child.","3909":"I can't believe this comes with three versions of the film - wow, what a bargain! I love this movie and most of Spielberg's others, so I'm very proud to have the poster this came with (the movie poster side facing forward - not the version comparison) on my door.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how quickly this arrived. Thanks, Amazon! You're the best resource a film buff could ask for.","3910":"This is the best DVD edition that has been released of this film. It has 3 different versions of this movie: Theatrical, Special and Director's Cut. The problem is that there are some altered and edited scenes, that are only shown in their entirety in the Theatrical version. But, the sound and visual quality is perfect on all of them and there's some good bonus features. So, this is totally worth the price. If you haven't seen this movie, see it.","3912":"I originally owned this on regular DVD and thought it'd be even better to own on Blu-ray with all the extra special features that most Blu-ray movies have to offer.","3913":"Entertaining and suspenseful on first viewing, a closer reading reveals the film's rather disturbing subtext, which effectively explains away what are, after all, crimes against people, as the understandable prerogatives of a Master Race:  i.e. too high above us to notice our \"rights\" and stuff.  Sig Heil! Mr. Spielberg?","3914":"It's wonderful to have the original version of this fine movie on DVD.  The Special Edition never was enjoyable.  Of course, it's a bonus to also have the Director's Cut in the same package.","3917":"This is truly a classic.  This movie kind of makes us all believe in close  encounters, and that it could happen to us, or what if??\nVery enjoyable.  Steven is an excellent writer and story teller.  I bet sitting around a camp fire he could spin a tale, and everyone present would be sitting there with goose bumps, their eyes wide open, their jaws dropped down to their chest.\nKeep writing Steven!  And keep making movies.","3919":"I liked it ever since seeing it on the big screen at a drive-in theater. Its a great addition to my small but building collection. I lost my everything several yrs back. so now i have have a steady home again so im rebuiding my movie collection and close encounters is a great addition i highly reccomend a copy of Close Encounters of th 3rd kind for anybody.","3920":"Great movie & a bargain priced DVD. Seller has quality DVD's. responds & ships very quickly. I couldn't be happier.","3921":"This is an excellent collector's edition. I can't believe that 30 years passed since this movie was released. Steven Spieberg and the movie really deserve this kind of edition. The package arrived perfectly.","3925":"Lots of extras, the stupid scene where he goes in the spaceship put in an earlier edition is out, very good transfer, sound, nice package.","3926":"I loved the insert poster that on the reverse lists out the timeline of the movie for all three included versions.  You can see what was added or removed for each version to decide which is the best to watch.  The book included provided very nice insight to the actors and director as well as to why each was hired for their particular skills and mindsets.  Overall, great collector set to own on BluRay.","3927":"the movie was great and as enjoyable now as when it was released.  the vhs cassette with case was in mint condition. thanks!!!","3928":"An Ultimate Edition for such a low price? How can I not resist? Comes with all the cuts of the film too so that's a bonus. A fun film about aliens, aliens that aren't trying to kill us by the way.","3929":"I liked the transfer on this Blue Ray.  Nice job for such an old movie. Not all older movies are transferred well like this one.","3930":"This is one of my all time favorites.  My expectations were a bit high for what to expect in the Blu-Ray format here.  The transfer is decent, at best.  Sounds was fantastic.  There was a lot of graininess in some of the low light shots.\n\nBecause there are three versions of the movie on one disk, my guess is that the compression may have been a bit higher.  This might explain the surprisingly low quality of the Blue-Ray version.","3931":"This movie was out in the 70's way before my kids were born.  I got this for them and they loved it.  It is a great family movie and very entertaining.  Very few movies now are enjoyable for the family, so I try to go back to the era of great movies and shows that had real humor, real horror, real suspense, real entertainment, and great story lines.....This is one of them.","3934":"Close Encounters of the Third Kind was the first classic of the UFO genre. This is a great movie, one that will awaken an interest in even the most casual observer of all things UFO. This product came with three different versions: Theatrical, Special, & Director's Cut.","3939":"Halloween classic!!","3940":"Childhood movie loved it soo funny.","3941":"Idle Hands is a fun dark comedy about teenagers dealing with brutal murder, horrible curses and prom.  Absolutely worth the watch if you want a few good chuckles.","3942":"Funny movie!  Horror comedy.","3943":"90s classic!!!","3944":"My kids and I love this movie. Funny and a classic.","3945":"Great","3948":"the blu-ray print of this film is TERRIBLE!  no better than the older DVD copy i have owned for years.  i really don't think a film of this age is worthy of a blu-ray release unless the film has undergone a digital restoration specifically for the blu-ray print.\n\nthe sound is wonderful but the picture is very grainy and not crisp at all.\n\nwhy waste your time and my money on releasing a new DVD that is no better than the old version?","3949":"this is one of my all time favorate movies even better on blu-ray love the sound","3950":"EXELENTE PELICULA SENCILLAMENTE FASCINANTE DE LO MEJOR DE CIENCIA FICCION EL MANEJO DE SPIELBERG SOBRE EL TEMA LA PUESTA EN ESCENA, EL SONIDO LOS EFECTOS TODO EXTRAORDINARIA.\nLA TENGO EN DVD NORMAL LA QUERIA EN BLU-RAY","3951":"Usually not one of my favorites of Steven Spielberg and don't ask me why. But this remastered Blu-ray looks and sounds fantastic! Also you get all 3 versions of the film to choose from. A must for any Spielberg fan and the quality is all there. One of the best Blu-ray's out there bar none!","3954":"Still a classic movie and fun to watch after all these years. Sure, there are some parts that are a little \"goofy\", but since we really haven't made first contact yet,(that we know of)we really don't know what to expect. Lets just hope they're as friendly as the ones in the movie !\n\nA big thumbs up from me !!","3955":"Funny and fun!","3956":"funny and creepy lot's of fun to watch","3958":"love the movie worked great","3959":"I thought it said blu ray and dvd i only got blu ray o well i guess i love this movie!","3960":"Over the years I lost my copy (maybe in Katrina).  A must for any Science Fiction fan.","3963":"Love it!!","3964":"Awesome movie","3965":"Thank You","3966":"Stupid movie","3967":"This movie has not aged well but its still fun, especially if you are watching it with someone who has never watched it. Definite Sunday afternoon wine and pop corn thing  to enjoy.","3968":"Great black comedy horror film that seems to be forgotten. Entertaining story about a stoner who is so lazy that he loses control of his right hand and it starts killing people when it becomes possessed by a demon.\n\nI think Devon Sawa is a great actor and wish he did more movies today.","3971":"The idea of an \"everyman\" confronting aliens is a great plot device, but Spielberg's ham fisted direction sinks this project. It COULD have been a classic. I was rather taken with it back when it played first-run, but now I can see that the effects work of Doug Trumbull and the music of John Williams were what really kept this afloat initially. Also, this blu-ray looks grainier than the theatrical presentation.","3975":"This item is clearly stated by Amazon to be the DVD-Audio of the SOUNDTRACK, yet almost all the reviews treat it as if it were a DVD of the MOVIE.","3982":"Very good transfer to BD, although I think a little more attention to cleaning up the film a bit more would've made it even better.  Great movie, sound is good, and really fun to watch.","3983":"I loved this movie when it came out long ago.  I owned the VHS for 10+ years, and it finally broke, so I ordered the DVD.  This movie is one of my favorites to watch around Halloween because it's creepy and gory and HILARIOUS!","3984":"Great Condition","3985":"This is a guilty pleasure movie for me.  Idle hands are the devil's plaything...so what happens when an idle hand gets loose?  It's worth a watch if you are into something campy and fun, and if you want to see young Jessica Alba, Seth Green, and Devon Sawa.","3986":"Visually a great LBX transfer, but sound is not well-balanced and there are NO EXTRAS...","3987":"great devon movie,  fun and kindasick","3989":"Funny. Remembered as a kid and had to watch it again. Glad I will have for my kids when they get older.","3990":"One of my favorite movies","3995":"awesome","3996":"good movie, pretty funny... and umm.. . . Jessica Alba.","3997":"Love this movie. Have watched it so many times","3998":"Great movie","3999":"Okay-- it's an old movie-that doesn't mean it isn't funny and it's really quirky --- at the time- it was a \"new' concept--- Give it a try and you'll agree it's worth the watch. Halloween would be good..","4002":"We just watched the director's cut of Close Encounters. I must say the picture quality for a thirty year old movie is excellent. We already own the regular DVD format for this movie and it was worth it to purchase it in Blu-ray.","4003":"It's a classic.  Just a little outdated.  Wasn't very exciting, but overall a pretty good movie.","4005":"As promised","4006":"My childhood movie!","4007":"Repeat \"title\" function is not available as is the case with alot of Blu ray dvds. My opinion is about the user convenience aspect of this release.","4008":"Bought as a gift, and the recipient loves it!","4009":"love this movie, came on time, great!","4012":"...this is important.  This is an awesome movie.  And you get all three versions of the movie.  It is a sci-fi geeks dream.  It cool to be able to sit down and compare the versions.  This is a classic and a must own.","4014":"AWESOME! Must have on Blu-ray; actually, any of Spielberg's films will do fine. I can't hardly wait for his other films to come out in Hi-def. This film rates high on my list, along with the newly released \"Bladerunner\" on Blu-ray. Now I'm going to look at the San Fernando Valley at night in a different respect as Spielberg did for his concept look for the Mother spaceship.","4015":"A true star studded (both actors & musicians\/band members doing cameos) cult classic with a great soundtrack. A mostly overlooked or broadly unknown, forgotten & definitely underplayed hilarious soft horror spoof that has not been available for sale on a regular basis. A must have for any horror\/comedy cult classic collection!","4016":"A classic movie,hadn't seen it in awhile still as good as the first time I saw it","4017":"Classic","4018":"Such a great movie. A cult classic!","4019":"Kinda strange movie but it's still good and oh my lord sexy jessica alba wow she is so beautiful and sexy as always and it's a combination of horror and comedy type of movie but overall still worth checking out","4020":"Love this movie!! Hilarious","4026":"The last time I seen this was thirty years ago and I'm glad I bought it! You get a three dvd set and its cool !!! The sound track is really cool in surround sound !!!!\n  D. L. Rupert","4027":"Saw it the first time while stationed at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and thought it was then and better now.","4028":"This is yet another amazing Blu Ray disc!  Perhaps better than the release prints.  The sound in DTS surround (and Dolby Digital) is amazing as well.  1977?  That's hard to believe.  All three versions of the film are here as well. You've no doubt seen the film and are interested in the transfer.  It's quite simply amazing!!!! Just get this one!  It'll push your system to its limits.","4029":"This includes 3 versions of the film.\nThe amazing blu-ray picture and audio quality make this movie seem new again.\nCan't recommend this title enough.","4030":"love this movie good fun","4031":"Older classic. If you like funny horror b movies, then this is one you will like.","4032":"Awesome Thanks","4033":"The dvd was pretty scratched but it played just fine. I loved this movie. it's a cult classic","4036":"All 3 versions of the film. Outtakes, huge documentary, still galore, 3 version comparison poster, storyboards, etc. And a very nice box and book to boot. Yeah, it's a little pricey. But for what you get it's well worth it for fans of this film.","4037":"this has to be by far my favoriate movie of all time.  It really makes you want to belive in life outside of our universie and to have it on DVD is even better.","4038":"This is the BEST one yet!  Everything included is terrific!  We've waited a long time (30 years) but it was worth the wait!  GREAT!","4042":"This film is the most unique work Spielberg ever produced on his own. While Spielberg has produced many great films this one stands alone as his true best. He was clearly in the zone when he did this.\n\nThis ultimate Blu-ray set is the last version you will ever need. Unless Spielberg comes to my home and talks with me during the screenings this is the last version I ever plan to own of this film.","4043":"This is a movie that truly proves \"We are not alone\"! Steven Spielberg is one of the best directors in cinema today. This 1977 classic features a superb cast with Richard Dreyfuss, Teri Garr and Francois Truffaut. The visual effects are spellbinding. If you are not a fan of science fiction, give \"Close Encounters\" a try. It's a great film for the family!","4046":"good movie","4047":"heres a movie thats really good ,it will keep you watching good halloween movie ,it will give you lots of scares and a few laughs to go with it,","4048":"This is a great comedy\/horror flick....the movie is very entertaining.... might add it to my collection sooner then later.","4049":"I REALLY liked this... but ya GOTTA have a warped sense-of-humor...\nleaning more toward the HUMOR than the SENSE.","4050":"classic","4051":"Give me anything with the gorgeous Jeessica Alba and I will be happy.","4053":"Close Encounters is a superb Speilberg film and this is his first film presented on high defintion disc. This BLU-RAY disc should look and sound fantastic. A fine film with state of the art special effects, and a wonderful John Williams score on the best High Definition format-BLU-RAY. A must buy regardless of price by anyone who loves movies in High Def.","4054":"If I had a husband that lost his job, didn't look for new work to support his family, trashes my kitchen, argues with me in front of our three kids, runs off to passionately kiss a single mom, then hops aboard a UFO, GOOD RIDDANCE!\n\nThe ending of the film should have been the aliens harvasting his organs. They wanted to know what a lousy earth husband was made of.","4058":"i love this silly stoner comedy movie Jessica Alba and Seth green a true classic","4059":"\"Idle Hands\" stars a slew of Hollywood A listers. Devon Sawa, Jessica Alba, Seth Green, and Vivica A. Fox lead this ensemble to save the world from evil. When Anton (Sawa) loses control of his hand to the devil because of his lazy, idle ways, all hell breaks loose. Murder after murder, the hand knocks off suburban inhabitants in creative ways. Raunchy, cornball comedy peppers the horror throughout the movie. Not too bad for what it is, but not family friendly.","4060":"Great item. It is exactly how it looks in the picture. Very happy with the product. Would definitely buy again.","4063":"Top science fiction entry boasts Spielberg's trademark epic sweep, and one of Dreyfuss's shining moments as the afflicted Neary. Director Truffaut is on-hand in a rare acting turn as French scientist Claude Lacombe, and Melinda Dillon excels as bewildered Mom Jillian, whose young son Barry (in a petrifying scene) has already gone up in the aliens' space ship. Don't miss this classic Spielberg spellbinder.","4069":"Yes it's one of those weird teen films but c'mon its hilarious and cool. Seth Green truly is funny. Not to forget Jessica Alba is amazing as well. These are one of those films that can make you feel good about yourself.","4070":"The movie arrived in time.  This is \"B-movie\" material for sure and not for everyone.  It's okay for the genre that it fits into.","4072":"Funny movie I remember watching this younger. Couldn't have come at a better time for Halloween. If you like dark humor you'll love this movie","4073":"It was just one of my favorite comedies and I had to have it for my collection. I am still enjoying it.","4074":"I love Speilberg films, I really do, but the fact that he is a good director is no excuse for this crap. I just do not like it, its not my thing. I can't belive that Richard Dreyfuss turned down reprising his role in Jaws 2 because he was filming this nonsense. If you want to watch it, then go ahead, we all have different tastes. However, if you want to see a real Speilberg film, watch ones like Duel, Jaws, ET, Schindler's list, Jurassic Park, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, and The Indiana Jones Trilogy.","4075":"I wondered if the disk had the original ending or the \"extended\" ending that came out a few years after the theatrical version.\n\nWell, it has the theatrical version ending;  the extended \"inside the ship\" ending is included in the extra scenes chapter.\n\nBetter this way, IMO, since the original leaves the sense of unknown in the viewer.  And the inside of the ship was kind of simplistic anyway - it looks like rock concert lights!","4078":"The single disc has the film in THX & DTS audio track as well as Dolby Digital. I was going to buy the two disc set just for those features, but if you are like me & watching your pennies, this is the way to go. The transfer is great & the DTS track is what you would expect from DTS.","4079":"When this movie was first released, I was barely at walking age. I remember seeing it on TV a few times over the years. I really liked it a lot. I finally decided to buy it and im glad I did. Yes, the film looks a bit aged, but for being almost 30 years old, it still holds up for the most part. I highly recommend that you buy the two disc special edition instead of the single disc edition. A lot of really good bonus material in the two disc edition.","4080":"This is one of Jessica Alba's best movies. It was one of her best because she wasn't well known at the time and was a pleasant surprise. The movie itself has a solid mix of horror and comedy mixed throughout. The premise was very good and original. The casting was solid as I was entertained from start to finish.\n\nThe bluray itself is a significant upgrade over the last issued DVD. It's really nice having this gem in HD!","4081":"I would watch this movie around Halloween if you are sick of getting horror movies with just massive amounts of blood and gore. It is more toward the comedic side rather than horror.","4082":"not as good i thought it would be it  had its moments though. not for kids, mistake. you will like it if you like to sit around and get high","4083":"It was a blast from the past!!!!!\nIt was a DVD so not to much to say so yer good good good yer yer yer","4084":"the acting was great for comedy and subject matter.  Fun movie to watch with friends on a saturday afternoon-Comedy horror","4086":"One of the top sci-fi\/fantasy movies of all time, this is one that keeps the possibility of other beings in our vast universe alive and well. Richard Dreyfuss's performance is masterful. Steven Spielberg's first movie about aliens is one of his best movies, period. Remastered in dts and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound with further enhancement by THX, it is a must own for it's likely to be one of the top 100 movies of all time.","4090":"This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is long and boring.  The main character is so easy to hate which makes the movie even harder to watch, when you wish he was dead. Not to mention the ending left me with the taste of rotting fecal in my mouth.\n\nFinal Review -------------  -5,321 Spielburg Snacks","4091":"bought it for my best friend and if you have seen the movie and have an idea about the main character and you have friends like this id recommend this movie, funny, little gore nothing big, but still very funny movie and it works great","4107":"I thorougly enjoyed this horror comedy and as a big Seth Green and Jessica Alba fan loved it even more (I didn't know Alba was even in it when I got it).\n\nGot great gross out moments, really funny comedy (loved it when he pushed the dog out into danger to check things out) and the whole thing kept me entertained.\n\nAlthough it's stupid, it's good stupid, glad I added it to my collection.","4109":"I bought this movie for my son-n-law for Christmas as that is what he wanted.  He enjoyed it.  It appeared to be in good shape, ie-no scratches on DVD.  It came in the amount of time estimated by Amazon.","4110":"This movie is amazing! Its got Devon Sawa, Jessica Alba and Seth Green! You cant go wrong with this spooky, high school comedy! Its from the 90s and its the most fun movie ever! The Offspring play at the school prom! Check this movie out!","4111":"Idle hands is a poorly made teenage serial killer film, in which a slacker teenager's hand is possessed and kills other teenagers.  Jessica Alba has a small part as a girlfriend.  Skip this film","4113":"Amazon, even though it could be expensive sometimes, it is worth it. Also, the delivery is very fast.","4118":"good movie","4119":"I love this movie. They should have got academy awards.  It will make you cry laugh and think how precious life is.  The women and these kids are out standing. Ed Harris I always love.  I need to buy,, I have watched at least 10 times.  Great Christmas movie if you get through the tears","4120":"A movie that makes you cry.","4124":"Lost in the hype around Star Wars, this gem of a movie is the smart man's \"sci-fi\" film. Superbly written and acted, featuring Spielberg's favorite everyman in Richard Dreyfuss who sees lights in the night sky. He can't explain it and against the wishes of those around him, feels compelled to investigate this frustrating enigma that becomes clear. Featuring powerhouse special effects and awesome score by John Williams. This is the movie that makes you think: ARE WE ALONE?","4139":"tried to watch , I couldn't make it all the way through. plot was bad. his has were posessed? eww gross. only good thing about this movie is j. alba","4145":"I had been hearing how great this movie was but I had never seen it. So I bought the dvd. I was a little disappointed. This version has the added scenes that were not shown in the original theatrical release, and maybe that is what I don't like. It is slow and too long. If you have already seen it and liked it then this is a good dvd, but if you haven't scene it, I would rent it first, just in case.","4151":"IDLE HANDS WAS THE FUNNIEST HANDS FILM I SAW SINCE EVIL DEAD 2, AND THIS IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST FILMS OF 1999, IT HAS DOPE SMOKER ANTON KILLING HIS PARENTS,FRIENDS,COPS,AND ANYONE WITHIN REACH.IT SOUNDS TASTELESS BUT IT IS QUITE HILARIOUS FOR A HORROR-COMEDY FLICK. A VERY HILARIOUS FILM.","4153":"This movie has the perfect balance of comedyy and horror. The animals in this movie are great. If you like what happens to the cat in Christmas vacation you will love what happens to it here. Jessica Alba is another upside in this movie adding a somthing that all guys want to see. Caution to those of you with weak stomachs or to some uptight people, this movie is really bloddy, has stoner humer, and has female nudity.","4154":"Wow, this movie was incredibly terrible. \"Idle Hands\" are the devil's playground. Nobody cares. Anton (Devon Sawa) is a teenager who uses his inhaler as an 'instrument.' Not cool dude. His right hand then becomes possessed and starts to murder. His parents, family and almost his girlfriend (Jessica Alba). That hand deserved major punishment going after \"Dark Angel\" like that. Aside from the horrible plot, watch this movie because of how good Jessica Alba looks, nothing else.","4155":"How could I have missed this blu-ray release of one of my favourites?! I always look for surprise release treasures on blu-ray and found this amongst them. An excellent transfer, with a touching tale of real life best friends Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon, who had been looking for a project with strong female roles to take on together for a long time. And they found it!","4156":"Amazing. Watch it.","4157":"I loved this movie. The interaction of the characters was heart felt. I recommend this movie. The actors were great.","4158":"CAN LOOK AT THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER.  A BEAUTIFUL MOVIE","4159":"Love it","4165":"I remember watching this movie in great amazement when I was a child.  It is such a great movie.  When I'd heard that it would be on DVD I had to rush out and get it.  I watched it with my ten year old stepson and he watched it with the same enthusiasm that I remember in myself.  Close Encounter's is truly one on the classics.  A wonderful movie to watch with your family.  If you've not seen it, you need to.","4169":"There's nothing wrong with this movie, if you like a bunch of bad tasted sequences, terrible acting, bad horror, this is the movie for you.","4173":"For anyone who loves X-files or anything dealing with the arrival of aliens on this planet, this is the film for you! The special effects are awesome and the story is brilliantly written and acted. and while there are government conspiracies, they are not as evil as in X-files. Close Encounters is a beautiful film that asks us to think about many questions dealing with life beyond earth.","4178":"I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE!I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! JESSICA ALBA IS HOT BUT THE MOVIE IS UGLY! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE! I HATE THIS MOVIE!","4180":"The humor is low and the horror is high! This teen flick will nauseate your stomahcs as Antoin Tobias (Devon Sawa) stars as a drug atic who sits around like a slug and disovers his hand has been possessed by Lucifer and he must stop it before he kills anyone else besides his parents! Jesica Alba stars as his hot girlfriend and Seth Green stars as Devon's duggy friend as well! NOT RECOMMENED! Rated R for nudity, strong horror violence, drug use and language.","4182":"what's the idea behind it, I spent the whole evening thinking of what they want us to see, it's violent movie, full of killing scenes. I saw horror movies before let's take an example (Blair Witch) this is something for real you feel your body shake like a blinder and you spend the whole night wake. this movie is not like this, they want to say that ideal hands are devils playground !!! or they just want us think that smoking drugs will cause you to do bad things, actually I do not recommend it.","4183":"I read and heard amazing reviews for this movie, so I wanted to like this movie... I really did. The cast is amazing! However, I did not like it. Too predictable, cheesy, and the line that made cringe in my seat was when the son asks the mother if she can teach his dad how to tie the shoe laces like she does. It seemed like an insensitive line, like the boy had no feelings for his mother. And the ending was the worst... I don't know I just did not get on this bandwagon.","4184":"the movie was what i expected. thank u\njust want to say thank waiting to exhale and it was good .","4185":"Such an amazing movie, you can watch it and watch it a billion time and you will always cry. I mean, come on now it's JR and SS as main actresses.","4186":"outta this world","4187":"One of my favorites","4189":"This episode is the epitome of what made the first year the best!  Never before or since has TV seen such chemistry between 3 beautiful women!  Watch for a very young Lauren Tewes (Julie McCoy from Loveboat...and Kim  Basinger BEFORE the Oscar!)...plus the one-liners from Jaclyn Smith are  worth price alone!  Must have for any Angels fan.","4194":"I remember seeing this at the theater and thought the DVD would be a good addition to my collection. My memory of the story was better than the DVD turned out to be. Too many special effects have happened since this movie first came out, and they make the ones in Close Encounters look contrived. I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it would. If you find it on sale you might want to pick it up.","4195":"Steven Spielberg went all the way with this cut of CE3K.  It includes all the scenes he originally wanted and eliminates the ending that was forced upon him by the studio for the Special Edition.  Truly a wonderful version of this great piece of cinematic art.","4197":"Yer another comedy flop. The film promises, but never quite delivers. Sure it's corny, hammy and dumb and for a while it's funny, but towards the end it just becomes stupid. These teen comedies don't really appeal to me, but the small horror content of this film saves it from being boring. It just could have been much funnier.","4198":"Rodman Flender delivers a very funny movie.  Yes, this is the movie where Seth Green proclaims \"I'm Leatherface.\"  This DVD is loaded with extras including deleted scenes and a making of documentary, plus a unique storyboard sequence.  This is NOT a horror film.  It is a comedy set against the backdrop of the horror genre and it succeeds at every point.  Sure to be a cult classic.","4199":"Well, all you'll get watching this freak movie is a little bit of gore ( bad special effects, by the way .. )and some young actors who seem to be wearing skirts yet ... Sad. Skip it.","4200":"Some fellow below said this is the best movie ever ....Uau... THis is a dishonest \"horror\" movie, taking some bad teen actors, adding some badly produced gore, making funnyless jokes all around ... Everyhting failed miserably here ( and I like to watch ridiculous horror movies, like \"SCREAMS\", \"NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET\",etc, just for the sake of laughing ). But this one is so bad, I almost ejected the tape from my VCR in the middle of it. A shame that actor so young accept to shoot this kind of garbage.","4201":"this is a completely boring film and one of Spielberg's worst films. Usually his movies are fantastic, like Indiana Jones, Jurassic Park, or even E.T., but this so damn slow and plodding! And this is coming from someone who loved Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey! Trust me, this movie is worthless, watch it only if you want to fall asleep in front of the TV.","4202":"If you've got the time to spare (and who didn't back in 1977?) then re-watching this old timer with a good picture is probably worth it. No commentary, but everything you would need to know is in the making of featurette, including tiredy looking Steven Spielberg on a Private Ryan set. He's a family man now, so he says he can't make movies about faithless men who leave their wives for a bunch of baloney. Why not? I suspect he may, like Lucas, be being put out to pasture soon.","4203":"Spielberg's awesome vision has finally made it to DVD and it was well worth the wait. Nice nuggets in the \"extras\" category, to be sure. But what's really gratifying, aside from the spectacular picture and sound quality, is that Spielberg chose to restore the film's original ending (without the silly boarding of the mothership). Stunning filmaking throughout.","4207":"THis movie is ridiculous. Even watching it as a black-horror comedy, it is horrible. To show gore is the only goal of the movie and even this fails, because the special effects are stupid. This could be a \"trash\" or \"B\" movie great picture, but everyone involved (teen actors, director, etc) are uninspired. This was a shame to the horror genre, which already is full of prejudices against it.","4211":"Great movie","4212":"Two great Actresses I love, great movie, I cried and cried.","4214":"I personally think this is one of Spielbergs greatest movies. Melding the wonder of the unknown with high adventure, it still gives me goose bumps 24 years later. Sure some of the effects look a little dated and the 70's hair do's are a distraction but look at the heart of the story and you see a classic.","4219":"Having not seen this movie since I was a kid, I felt like I was watching the movie for the very first time. It was great. The sound was wonderful on my system, and my friends are now all inviting themselves over to watch it too. It's great for all ages, and other than a few clothing styles, it's truly a timeless classic.","4221":"This is such a classic film, it's hard to review.  So great to see special effects that were really special, and not just a bunch of CGI.  The acting is superb, the story is beautiful and inspiring, and the added material on the DVD edition was really neat to see!  If you've seen this film, then you probably know what a jewel it is.  If you haven't --  you should!","4229":"I was really surprised how well this film held up.  A marvelous movie with marvelous DVD extras.  Don't be surprised if the ending is different than you remember.  This is actually the ORIGINAL ending to the film, not the ending that Spielberg was persuaded to put on the \"Special Edition\" re-release of the movie.  The other ending is contained in the special features, if you miss it.","4230":"I expected Idle Hands to be a straight horror film but I ended up laughing through most of it.  Devon Sawa gives a great performance as a teenager who is stoned out of his mind most of the time.  And Seth Green was cool too;  much better in this film than in Austin Powers.","4231":"This is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.  Its too bad it didn't do well in the theaters, it came out a little after Columbine, but it seems to be enjoying a happy life on video and DVD.  Every horror  fan should have this movie in their collection!","4232":"i wrote a review earlier saying that vivicia fox got half naked at the end but i think it was jessica alba or something i think.anyway,this movie is totally worth getting.after you rent it,you'll want to buy it! it was  hilarious! very entertaining.see this movie!","4240":"Thanks! Love it! Fast shipping","4241":"very good quality and shipped fast, very pleased","4242":"This movie has always been a classic movie in my family","4244":"Love it Love it Love it.  Great movie; down to earth and factual","4245":"Excellent acting and good story.","4246":"Really good always a good story for everyone to watch!","4247":"This is an excellent movie.  Everything about it is memorable.  The reason I only gave it three stars is that the movie is in full screen format, not widescreen.  Considering I paid $11.00 for the dvd, I would have thought it would be in widescreen for an older film.  This is one problem I have with ordering films online, Amazon in particular.  They used to specify what format the film was, but rarely do, now.","4248":"I love this movie.  I think it's beautifully written, produced and directed and highly under-rated.  I never tire of it.","4251":"Steven Spielberg's epic film that brainwashed the world into accepting alien invaders with open arms and a five-note melody arrives in a great looking two disc set that includes a fascinating new 102 minute \"making-of\" documentary and 10 deleted scenes.  The lush 137 minute widescreen transfer is apparently the third version of the film and is Spielberg's definitive version.  For now.  Rated PG.","4259":"Realistic blended family story line.  It's a struggle.","4260":"I already have a copy of it but I bought it for my sister bf's Mom for Mothers Day. I thought she might enjoy it as much as I do","4263":"Great special effects are of course of value in science fiction but here the draw is really the characters.  I felt invested in each of the main characters and wanted to keep watching.  The music was haunting and well planned, adding wonderfully to the atmosphere of the story.  Might be too frightening for young children but not boring to non-science fiction fans since the focus is on what drives and pushes the characters.","4264":"This is a cult classic movie about an unexpected event - close encounters of the third kind. When it's on DVD, this is a must for your collection.","4268":"This is one of the most amazing movies you will ever see. It's one spectaculer movie. Just to say, STEVEN SPEILBERG is my hero, my favorite director, and the best director. I am his biggest fan. Just to say, I would  recommend this movie to anyone. They will love it.\nFamly Apeal: 10 Music:  10 Special Affects: 10 Sound: 10 Overall: 10","4269":"A classic not only of thoughtful science fiction in the tradition of \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", but of cryptic suggestion: Dozens of threads are tied together only slowly, as the viewer gains slowly  more and more access to the facts.  Built on a rock-solid performance by  Richard Dreyfuss, this is one of the true greats.","4270":"My daughter and I loved his film when it came out many years ago and it never seems to get dated or old. Still our \"girls night out\" favorite!  A definite keeper.","4271":"Love Susan and Julia!! Very good movie!","4272":"Wife loves it","4273":"Good; if you like this kind of movie.","4274":"I just love this movie!","4275":"Good","4276":"Awesome movie!","4277":"tearjerker everytime, yet its one of those movies that you cannot help but watch. It has an all star cast and makes you step back to appreciate the little things in life. Loved it!","4278":"Very good condition!","4279":"Great deal","4280":"OK, this is a chick flick, tear jerker, but its very well acted and pretty realistic.  If the girlfriend, wife, or significant other wants a good cry, this movie will provide it.","4281":"This movie had me choking up at almost every moment ,great movie !!","4282":"A lot of good acting but ultimately sad story.  A great scene with the teenage daughter outside her school.","4283":"Love this movie.  Upgraded from VCR to DVD.","4284":"Great cast!  Great Movie!","4285":"worth watching.","4286":"No matter how often I see this movie I still end up a crying baby. Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts makes this movie go over the top... the little boy helps bring many laughs especially in screens that is wonderful.","4287":"Okay movie, but not as good as I thought it would be.","4288":"You will cry!  Deep, heartfelt, real, and sometimes ugly... which of course makes it beautiful.","4289":"Thanks","4290":"I love this movie. I downloaded this on my kindle. Would definely buy more movies with Julia Roberts!","4291":"a tearjerker","4292":"Cant pass up a movie with these two ladies in it.  Great and emotional.  Worth the watch.","4293":"Good","4294":"love it","4295":"Great movie!","4296":"love the movie vary sad","4297":"Great movie. Love the house she lives in. The scene of horseback riding in the moonlight in the snow was breathtaking!","4298":"Good","4299":"Great movie.","4300":"Good actresses n nice story line","4301":"I was very pleased","4302":"I love this movie!! The packaging was very nice, and my DVD's were delivered quickly.","4303":"Perfect!","4304":"Very touching movie","4305":"will tug at you heart and make you laugh, as well.","4306":"Sad but envigorating at the same time","4307":"Loved it","4308":"I've seen this film a dozen times, mostly because my daughter Anna is in it, portrays Martha Washington in Thanksgiving pageant. But regardless of that, it's truly a wonderful film,moving and funny at times. I tear up every time at the finale.","4309":"Got this for my grandmother.  No complaints from her so I assume it's fine.","4310":"Great..super fast delivery!","4311":"Tender and tough at the same time, this is a timeless story.  A classic.","4313":"Not my type of movie!","4315":"Now if only all divorced couples could eventually resolve marital issues and accept ex-mates new spouses and blend families as harmoniously as possible we all could turn a new page in child rearing.  This movie definitely shows both the negative and positive sides in family issues with exes & steps.  The movie goes to the heart and also has some valuable lessons for all to strive for when trying to do the best for our children of broken homes.","4316":"great movie","4317":"Classic movie, just classic. Heavy and light all at the same time.","4318":"Tear jerk for amyone. I don't care how tough and rugged you think you are. Not to mention it has some award winning actors and actresses in it. Very said movie, but also heck this could happen. To anyone. And being a cancer serviver it means a lot to share this with you","4319":"great","4320":"Got what I ordered, I'm happy","4321":"A tear-jerker but great actors in the cast!","4322":"Awesome movie.  This is a movie you can watch again and again.  A little sad though.","4323":"Movie collection","4325":"I did not see this movie until after I became a stepmom, and I'm telling you something I cry like a baby. I accurate portrayal of how a stepmom is feeling, and a bio-mom is feeling really hit home with me. As this is a movie, the fairy-tale goal is there, but I think it's what many families want, just can't get there... I won't give away the story but it's worth your money.","4327":"very compelling movie.  makes you think about relationships  and making an effort to get along with each other--everyone has to give in a little.  i really enjoy this movie..","4328":"My newcrack movie.  Watched it over and over from the point when they have a drink together and decide to spill their guts and be moms to the kids, and just love everyone...that is the answer people!","4329":"While Stepmom is a PG-13 film, it does indeed have a good message.\nAfter loved ones pass they're truly never gone.\nI watched this in my \"Family Living & Parenthood\" class senior year, and it was my first time seeing it.\nJulia Roberts is great in the role of the younger, sexy girlfriend, and Susan Sarandon (like always) is wonderful in her role as the jealous mother.\nOverall, I recommend Stepmom for anyone who is nearing their teenage years.","4330":"Again, another great Julia Roberts movie. This movie really pulls at your heart strings no doubt! I'm really glad I bought it!","4331":"This movie has great actors and a very good story. I Love It! I recommend it to all Julia and Susan fans.","4332":"I absolutely love this video and the story is very entertaining not to mention the beautiful scenery and holidays in this movie. I watch\nit over and over and still cry at the end.  New York is the location and it is beautiful. You won't be disappointed.","4333":"This is an amazing movie - heart-wrenching, gut-wrenching - addressing real-life issues from a unique angle.  Get ready for a tear jerker.","4334":"Julia roberts does an awesome job .. helps where she can and tries very hard to make it a great time","4335":"Another Julia Roberts DVD for my collection.  I also like Susan Sarandon I have a few of her movies like Banger Sisters. DVD arrived in great condition and earlier then I thought.","4336":"Solid story that touches the heart.  Just not that fond of either actress.  Too bad they let politics get in the way of their acting.","4337":"Get your Kleenexes ready.....this performance by three strong actors is a must have for your DVD collection! And don't give your copy away --a keeper for those dreary Saturday afternoon \"I have nothing better to do than to watch this AGAIN!\" films. I love it!","4338":"Good story, very current. I hope writers keep writing interesting stories like this. Enjoyed the ending, very positive, loved it.","4339":"An exceptional move.  Great actors and good story line make for a movie to be watched over and over again.","4340":"I love this movie! I watched it years ago & since it was a VHS back then, I replaced it with a DVD, watched it and was very touched by the storyline & all that the characters go through. Easy to relate to by anyone who's had divorced parents, been one, been a spouse coming into a broken family and having to learn and grow throughout the experience; you see that the only way to make it work is to surrender to it. Very touching.","4341":"guilty pleasure fave...own because I can never get enough of it and consider it one of my classic go to cry movies\/family drama","4342":"I have watched this movie I bet 10 times, maybe more and everytime I do, I cry. The actresses and actors are perfect, the plot of perfect, everything is perfect.","4343":"LOVED IT. SAD> SAD> SAD.... but it was amazing acting great players... even the kids could act and not just look cute... and many women d face this in our life time may we always keep them in our prayers... and if you know a kid who lost his mom... be more of a friend... kind and show them attention.... this is one hell of a film... two women's stories with the male bastard stuck in the middle.","4344":"This is a great story with its sad and happy times. I would recommend this move to everyone I know. The condition of this movie upon arrival was excellent.","4345":"Awesome movie... no flaws. Arrived quickly. Thank you! I keep forgetting what DVDs I want when I search for them, but I always know once I remember, I can find the movie I want!","4347":"This story shows how family can learn to work through any problem. The acceptance of a stepmom can be difficult and Julia really comes through.","4348":"This is soo good.  The movie is like real life stuff that goes on in peoples lives.  I believe you would enjoy it.  It makes you happy, sometimes sad and a lot of things to relate to.  I recommend this.","4349":"I love this movie and how it shows how even in sad circumstances life can still be beautiful. Grace, understanding and trying to make things work out for the best is not always easy but still the best way.","4350":"This movie has funny parts, but it also has sad parts.  It is a good drama, and I recommended it to those who enjoy emotional movies.","4351":"Purchased this DVD as a christmas gift for a female member of the family. She really enjoys the movie and is glad to finally have it on DVD. Great price, fast shipping.","4352":"Julia Roberts with a all star cast, this is a wonderful story of family trying to over come many problems off everyday life and then trying to come together as one family must buy.","4353":"very good very wonderful ve fo scvjkldnhvclksnr sdlk\/fnhrskdvcnh jdgsklvnhlsdfkn ,\/sdgfnsvhk lksdngfwklrsvn \/lskdngfrlkvfnhlkn lksdfnglkvnhlkdzsfne\/Kn lk\/gtrnjwlrkjnlgkn\/s,dfnewL:Knj .,sdngtwlrknvtgnlsrkn sdfnglwkre lknjsdFK sdnmfkl; .,dfgnmrkl;nj ,snmkdfkl","4354":"i have always loved this movie and now i own a copy. the cast works so well together.my term tear jerker is for movies that are happy and sad i'm sure people out there will understand this.","4356":"This was a wonderful movie.  It was very realistic.  There were very touching moments as well as sad ones.  It held my attention the entire time.  I definitely recommend it.","4358":"'Stepmom' features the conflict between the ex (Susan Sarandon) and her replacement (Julia Roberts), augmented by the childrens' natural loyalties to their mother. Lots of tart-tongued dialogue in the beginning, with preventable and meaningless conflicts at the PTA, the home, etc. Eventually they come together, drawn by the ex's slow death from cancer. Maudlin, boring, and way too long.","4360":"I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.","4362":"I Loved this movie. I love Susan and I thought Julia did a very good job in this film. It is full of emotions, love, comflict, rivals, misunderstandings. joy. grief and forgivness and finally acceptance. I watch it often and it is new and fresh to me each time","4365":"I watch this movie because I love Ed Harris and his eyes:) and the Victorian House in the woods!! These two things are worth watching the movie for.","4366":"Stepmom starring Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon is a funny and moving film directed by Chris Columbus. Ed Harris also stars and jeez isn't he great in every movie?! I like Roberts in this film, she plays her role as a stepmother with humor and heart. Sarandon's character is a bit annoying but hey she's dying of cancer. Sad, sad, sad film, I highly recommend it!","4368":"I love this movie! Julia Roberts, once again does a fantastic job at making her character vibrant, and very creative. The writer tells the story about a family in and out of crisis- and shows us how that no matter their challenges with each other- their efforts taken to forgive and persue understanding, allows them to connect in a love relationship with one another that was encouraging for my own person life. Thanks.","4371":"I bought this DVD for my collection.  I do not buy full screen format DVDs.  Amazon described the DVD as \"Anamorphic, Closed-captioned, Color, Dolby, Full Screen, Widescreen, NTSC\" with an aspect ration of 2.35:1.  However, when it arrived, it was Full Screen only with an aspect ratio of 1:33.1.  Consequently, I returned it.  My recommendation, if you only want Widescreen, don't believe the description that this DVD is dual-layered and don't buy it.","4379":"Stepmom may not be a definate classic but It will be remembered as a sad sad movie.  It is one of the most heartbreaking films I have ever seen.  Susan Sarandon gave what should've been an Academy Award nominated performance as a single mom battling cancer.  Julia Roberts has another good performance as well as Ed Harris.  The film does move you and make you feel lucky.  It isn't my favorite, but for anyone who loved Terms of Endearment and Steel Magnolias this is the movie for you.","4386":"I love this movie. It made me cry, and was very much like Beaches (in some way) If you loved Beaches the movie, you'll love this.","4388":"I saw this movie one weekend recently, and at first, I thought it was a bit boring.  Then, I just relaxed and I was amazed by the acting chemistry between all of the characters.  The story was a bit typical for any movie like this.  The kids did a really good job.  They acted as though they've been in the business since before they were born.  Definitely a great movie, but make sure you have plenty of tissues, because you will cry!","4389":"This is a terrible movie.  Not only is the acting quite pathetic, but the entire plot is dull and predictable.  This kind of movie has been done a thousaund times, and there are far better versions out there.  I felt sorry for those poor kids that had to play in this movie, so I gave it 2 stars.","4391":"A nice but tired story. But, how much more interesting it would have been if Lynn Whitfield had played Julia Robert's part with an otherwise unchanged cast. In addition, Lynn Whitfield is a far better actress than Julia Roberts. Of course this is a no-no in racist USA.","4397":"One of the films that launched Julia Roberts into superstardom as an actress.  Here's a situation that so many of us can relate to; children from a previous marriage are torn between their natural parent and a new stepparent.  This film has a wonderful blend of funny and heart-wrenching moments.  A precociously good performance is rendered by young Liam Aiken as \"Ben\".  This is another film that has to be placed on the \"don't miss\" list.","4401":"I loved this movie! It's very touching, it's sad and made me cry at the end, but it does have some funny parts thax to the cute young boy in the movie!) It's basically about a 13 yr old girl and her little brother who dislike their stepmom and, like all, absolutely love their real mom. You watch and see the rest.","4404":"After seeing this movie I ran to call my mother. This is an extremely touching and moving movie. It centers around Ed Harris and Susan Sarandon, who are divorced, having to deal with the fact that Sarandon has been  diagnosed cancer. In addition Julia Roberts is now about to marry Ed Harris  a.k.a. the name STEP MOM.\nI completely enjoyed this movie. From its  sadder to happier moments. I say watch with your mom.","4408":"Isabel (Roberts) is the photographer live-in girlfriend of Luke (Harris). Luke is divorced from Jackie (Sarandon). Jackie and Luke's two children, moody preteen Anna (Malone) and wanna-be magician Ben (Aiken) are rotten to  Isabel because that is how her mother feels. When Jackie becomes terminally  ill, however, she decides that the relationship between Isabel and the  children must improve so that they will still have a mother figure.  Touching well acted movie.","4412":"This movie is wonderfull. It is sad it is funny but most of all it is touching. I love evrey min... Of this film. This is a must see.","4413":"\"Stepmom\" is a beautiful movie about a woman dying of cancer who is about to be replaced by a younger, more attractive woman.  Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts are so wonderful together in this film!  Both of  them earned my applause.  Jena Malone is great as the jilted daughter, as  is Ed Harris.  This is gonna jerk a lot of tears, but it is a magnificent  movie that should be shared by families all over the world.","4416":"I think the leading performences where rich and powerful,specially Susan Sarandon. It is an excellent Hollywood style movie,it was charming and well done. Chris Colombus done it again.","4417":"Ok, I rented this because I figured my girlfriend would like it, but so did I. Michelle Pfeiffer is her most riveting. I normally don't like Treat Williams, but I found his character very beleivable here. Also the young  man who played Vincent (17 yr. old) will do well to keep acting, he has a  road ahead of him. I know it sounds like a movie-of-the-week plot, but it  is quite effective. The DVD itself has a short (5 min) featurette, that is  about as enlightening as it sounds.","4420":"Tom Hanks is the young yuppie in Chicago who is a big hot-shot ad man, and Jackie Gleason (in his last screen role) is his father who has just lost his meager job and is facing divorce. Gleason comes across as most unlovable, and the conflict between Hanks and him produces quite a bit of noise. The selfish Hanks has to make some sacrifices for his father, as expected--there's the message. The movie tries to do too much, though, and not much of it in any depth. It's all surface.","4423":"Tom Hanks and one of my ALL-TIME favorites, Jackie Gleason together!  Great movie!","4424":"A really good movie.\n\nA heartfelt drama with some comedic moments about a son estranged from his parents but finds his way back to them through the course of several crises the parents experience.","4426":"First off I love Michelle phieffer movies and this is another hit that she made. Definitely worth buying and for the price you can't do any better. By the end of the movie I had tears of joy","4427":"This movie is not credible on a psychological level. Sam\/Ben was too well-adjusted, too articulate, and too mature for his age. Any kid in real life would not be expected to abruptly pack his bag and leave his home behind. He would not have been able to psychologically heal--never mind forgive--his older brother. It would have taken years of therapy for the family to come together as a family. Basically, this is an escapist, feel-good movie with competent enough acting.","4428":"Great movie hadn't seen in a while then got this and just loved the drama to it","4429":"Great old school movie , loved it heartwarming , a must watch.","4430":"Loved it.  Thankyou.","4431":"I love these great actors together along with EVA MARIE SAINT.Such a funny and wonderful story. This is one of my all time favorite films. I love the background music as well.","4432":"Funny, heart warming movie","4433":"TITLE IS CORRECT.  NOTHING  IN  COMMON.","4434":"Overlooked classic!\n\nFirst dramatic role for Tom Hanks that showed his range and talent","4435":"Hanks and Gleason a hard combo to beat. the best in great viewing","4437":"Good story!","4438":"a","4440":"Two great stars; one good film.","4441":"awesome","4442":"Too depressing.  The only one of Tom Hanks' movies I didn't care for.","4443":"Good movie.","4444":"Some great line, especially the answering machine.","4445":"I love it","4446":"Very riveting movie, powerful performance by MP, tear jerker!","4447":"Was a good movie.","4448":"Great. :)","4449":"Pitiful!","4450":"Not very good","4451":"Another exceptional movie with Tom Hanks, but also with the Great One, Jackie Gleason, who adds a lot of seasonong to the story line.","4452":"Jackie Gleason is wonderful in this!  He and Tom Hanks have a good chemistry.","4453":"A touching and amusing story with a great script and good acting. Well worth seeing. A long time favorite.","4454":"One of my all-time favorite movies. I even think that Jackie Gleason should have won a supporting actor Oscar for his part.","4455":"good movie","4456":"Great movie","4458":"Great movie!  Arrived on time and in good condition.  Wonderful acting and I highly recommend this movie about mother and son, reconnecting many years after the child was kidnapped.  Michelle Pfeiffer plays a phenomenal role!","4460":"Love this movie! Great item and fast shipping!","4462":"gift","4463":"A perennial favorite of mine. Jackie Gleason's last acting role and a poignant, funny, thoroughly entertaining movie","4465":"Looks of good actors and compelling stories.  I do get tired of this stereotype that young female professionals are heartless and lacking in empathy, and too full of ambition.  Overall, a good story, even though dated by the 1980's clothing styles and hair - yuk!  Did we really look like that back then? Probably so...","4469":"Great..super fast delivery!","4470":"This movie will touch your heart in ways you never imagined, especially if you are a parent.\nBeautiful, heartbreaking and enlightening, with a surprisingly refreshing end.","4471":"Outstanding Cast! A very emontional movie! Michelle Pfeiffer has always been.my.fav actress since I saw her in,\"The Witches Of Eastwick\",but when I saw her in this moving role. I felt honored..cause she is the best! The whole cast was super,this was such a wonderful movie,I think every cast member derserves an Oscar! Whoopi you did your thing in this movie also! Great Book and Movie!!","4473":"This father son movie is pretty entertaining. I don't much care for Gleason but he holds his own in this\none and is OK to watch what will happen. But Tom is at his best tho you is much younger","4474":"Wonderful movie that almost no one knows about - Tom Hanks at the height of his funniness AND some serious themes handled gently and movingly.","4475":"The presentation (video and audio) is above passable and more than adequate for fans of the film.  Saw this in the theater, and it's comperable to what I saw; I remember it that well.  Recommended.","4476":"I'm one of Tom Hanks' biggest fans and he never disappoints.  Funny story about dealing with one's parents while they go through a separation and drag their adult kid in the middle.  Along the way he does some growing up of his own with the help of his high school friend once girlfriend but now best friend.","4477":"I just love the pictures and updated sound quality from Bluray movies that were transfered from either VHS or older DVD's and so will YOU!!!!","4478":"What can I say it's Arny! - A young lad has the oportunity to meet his favorite action hero on the big screen (liteally goes into the screen) using a special gold ticket.- Eventually all the baddies find a way of escaping the world of film and coming off the screen into the \"real\" world where they create havoc - Highly recommended.","4480":"Received as expected in great condition.","4481":"ok","4482":"Loved this movie because I loved the book that it was based on.  Michelle did a wonderful job as the mother in this movie.","4483":"First I read the book and I loved it. Then I saw the movies a few years later. When I saw that it was out in DVD I had to have it in my DVD collection because I enjoyed that much.","4485":"I have always loved this movie.... I grew up on it!!!! Its in really good condition.... What a great purchase","4486":"One great family movie.  We had watched it on TV, and decided to add it to our collection so we can watch it whenever.","4487":"As one can see from the reviews, this is a good film.  However, I was disappointed not to see more of Jackie Gleason, which is the reason I bought it.  He was a great man\/comedian and I loved watching him.  I felt the film dwelled too much on Tom Hank's character playing around, etc. and I just wanted to see more of Gleason I guess.  Good film though and the ending is heartening.","4489":"What a cast. Tom Hanks before his superstardom in Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Cast Away with the Great One,Jackie Gleason in his final movie role. The chemistry works between these two. The acting was first rate between these two. I liked this movie. Well worth watching again!","4491":"A very funny movie. Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best.","4492":"Classic Action Flick that delivers as promised.","4493":"I LOVE LAST ACTION HERO IT'S ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGERS BEST COMEDY","4494":"Boring Movie.","4495":"i love it its one of my favorite i had in a vha and i couldn't play it any more","4496":"It has a really nice plot and positive ending. A movie with both learning and teaching moments. Highly recommended for all ages.","4501":"a mostly bad story with plenty of frustration. First off. what mother would ever think of taking three kids to a class reunion, especialy a baby? After \"Ben\" disappears and the remaining family structure falls apart the lead charecter turns to \"super cop\" Whoopi for counciling, ya right.\n\ndon't bother with this one.","4503":"Pfeiffer plays a mother who is devastated when her son goes AWOL in a crowd. Nine years later he returns - but is he her real son? Unbelievable coincidences apart, Deep End of the Ocean tries too hard to be faithful to Jacquelyn Mitchard's best-selling source material and winds up falling between more stools than a wino at a Scatologists convention. Pfeiffer, as always, glows.","4505":"Very good movie. Kid is stolen, Mom goes crazy, family becomes a mess. Kid is found but its all unpredictable. Rent it and see how the story unfolds.","4508":"Great movie. Thanks","4509":"This is a different type movie.  On purpose.  It is Arnold Schwarzennegger mocking himself as an action hero.  I actually think this is one of his best movies.  It has plenty of action, humor cameos a little bit of everything.  And it's entertaining and a good way to kill two hours.","4510":"Good movie","4511":"Anything Arnold is 5 stars in our house.","4512":"GOOD","4517":"It was absolutly great, Michelle Pfieffer's best. You'll  laugh, you'll cry. You'll want to hug your family and never  let go! Everyone should see this. It's. . . well, HEARTWARMING!","4519":"Classic Arnold","4520":"Good movie","4521":"I love this movie.  I know, it is silly; but, I love it anyway.  My only negative would be that it appears to be DVD quality, not 1080 HD.  Maybe that is because of of low-budget filming.  Or, maybe we were tricked.  I am considering returning it.","4522":"Sub par acting but it's Arnold had to get it","4523":"Bit rate for video is decent. 23-30Mbps. The movie is very grainy and some dark scenes are poor in quality. The audio track is laughable for Blu Ray. Bitrate is 448Kbps. The usual bit rate for audio is usually near 5000kbps. If it had cost me more than $5 I would have been mad. This is  a cheap transfer of the movie. The company supporting this release is Mill Creek Entertainment and clearly they have something to do with this poor rip.","4524":"the cast in this movie is trying to make this movie dramatic and touching but is wasted with bad acting and cheesiness. Michelle Pfeiffer could have done a lot better. Whoopi Goldberg was kinda good in this","4526":"I like this movie I think evrey one in this movie dose a grate job. But I would day this movie is worth a chance to watch it a couple of time but I would not say it is worth anuff money to buy.","4527":"DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE ! THE CHILD THEY LOST 10 YEARS AGO ; NOW LEAVES JUST 2 BLOCKS AWAY FROM HIS PARENTS !  THE END .... DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE TOO... MICHELLE PFEIFFER'S PERFORMANCE IS WORTH IT THOUGH","4528":"Ive always liked this corny movie and for the price and Blue-ray you cant beat it. Go Arnold.","4529":"Arnold was one of my favorites back in the day so I thought this was a great buy.","4530":"A good addition to the collection and always wanted this one to add to it being a Arnold fan","4531":"All the one-liners and action you crave.","4532":"exactly what I wanted","4533":"How do you get to Carnegie Hall?!","4534":"Great movie to watch with the kids!","4535":"worst direction","4536":"What a great\/fun movie. Nice picture quality!","4537":"Good  movie","4538":"Great old movie.","4539":"Love it!!!","4540":"I don't see why people were hating this movie. This is Arnold Schwarzenegger at his best. I admit I LOVE IT!!! Especially at the end I shed a tear. That's how good it is with a great ending.","4541":"good service good movie","4542":"It was very funny! So many subtle and not so subtle references to so many movies.","4544":"I had a blast with this movie","4545":"Arnold Schwarzenegger and Austin O'Brien star in this 1993 action-fantasy.\nThis features a young boy who is given a magic ticket allowing him to go into\nthe movie world where he meets his action icon. I saw this when it first\ncame out and it's not bad. Arnold is great usual and also plays himself.\nThe film also pokes fun and pays tribute to action films. Charles Dance,\nAnthony Quinn, Tom Noonan and others also appear. This blu-ray has\ngood picture and sound, but no features. I still recommend this.","4546":"Really good","4547":"Arnold Rocks!","4548":"The DVD and the case was in great shape. I liked the story. The reason that I gave it a 4 star rating was because it did not have caption for the hard of hearing.","4549":"awesome flick edge of your seat action","4550":"As always... another bitchin Schwarzenegger movie!\n\nNo real features, but glad to own it.","4551":"The idea was good but the acting-especially the children actor- is so very bad.\nAlso the transformation from the real world and the screen world is unbelievable,\n\nIt was not a good film when i first watched and it was not a good film when I watched again with the cheap bluray verison that I bought.","4552":"Ahhhnold at his self-deprecating best, a parody of out-of-nowhere explosions, bodies flying around, and cars crashing for no apparent reason. If you like Arnold, you'll love this one.","4553":"Excellent fun action adventure movie that showcases Arnold Schwarzenegger's action hero persona and his wit.\n\nWell worth watching and owning.","4554":"A Great Parody of all the Action Hero Movies. Arnold is Excellent. I loved the Film.","4555":"great movie","4556":"not quite as good as we had remembered it to be.","4557":"I may be one of the few that actually enjoyed this movie. Arnold was not at his best but the movie itself never took itself too seriously. It was the whole point. Anyone looking for more this was not the movie for you.","4558":"I got what I expected. Not disappointed at all!","4559":"Excellent service!!!!!  Some of these old Schwarzenegger film are a kick!!!","4561":"Classic! A Must Have For Blu-Ray Collectors.","4562":"Awesome","4563":"Has some good laughs, but mostly pretty stoopid.  Even my 13-year-old, who loves Arnold, only felt like watching the first half.  Notable for debuting Bridgette Wilson, who was so memorable in Shopgirl among other movies.","4564":"I Love it","4565":"He is good in this one.","4566":"I like how the kid is like most of us when watching a movie, pointing out obvious movie mistakes, things that only happen in a movie, how real life is completely different, yet how much you would enjoy spending time with  your favorite character, not the actor, but the character. What kid would not like to spend time with their hero, being able to take a break from reality.","4567":"love it","4568":"My husband and sons love this movie!","4569":"Excellent","4570":"From reality to screen.\n\nOr is it, screen, back to reality.\n\nKid gets to live out a fantasy of action.\n\nWill Arnold be the hero?","4571":"Good","4572":"Too many bad reviews miss the POINT . It was meant to be a bit of a JOKE. But media ruined the punch line before it had a chance","4573":"Not the best Arnold movie ever made but the price was right and I am glad to have this movie in my collection.","4574":"Item as described. Thank you.","4575":"Last Action Hero, is amazing!  I love this action packed, Exhilarating movie that will live in my heart forever!!","4576":"Lost our original 15 years ago and was thrilled to get this copy!!!!","4578":"This was a fun to watch movie the plot is that of a 90s movie.  This is one of those movies you can lay back and enjoy.","4579":"Arnold not taking himself too seriously","4580":"good","4581":"No a bad movie, just not as good as Arnold's action movies.","4582":"love this action filled movie...","4583":"My husband said they did an excellent job with the Blu-Ray transfer.  A very fun movie that still holds up.","4585":"Arnold seems flat in this film","4586":"is this Mr S's least known movie? it is a very supple satire","4587":"good movie","4588":"good","4590":"Very Satisfied","4591":"Looks great, but no extras.","4592":"excellent","4593":"What can I say, it's Arnie.","4594":"great movie!!!!","4595":"delivered on time and as described","4597":"Don't believe the critics on this one. This movie got horrible reviews but I actually liked it. This movie had one of the biggest budgets of its time and didn't even come close to making  a profit. This is a movie that was cursed by the reviews and people stayed away. Give this movie a try. It was really good","4598":"Love me some Arnold. Not his best but still fun.","4599":"pretty bad stuff","4600":"Excellent movie. Watched this a lot in the past but now I own it. It's how movies were meant to be made....little but good computer graphics and more of the live action! Good story line and entertaining:)","4601":"Arnold at his best, mocking Arnold.","4602":"Great old Arnie flick - glad to have it in my collection - SBJ","4604":"what if.........","4605":"Last Action Hero is probably Arnold's worst movie. I would recommend most of his other films, not this one.","4606":"movie is much better than the reviews. the blu ray quality is poor. not any better than dvd.","4608":"Great product and vendor!","4610":"Super Fast. New. Thanks","4611":"Without question or contest, this is Schwartzenegger's most underrated. Thank the world for Sourcefed's movie club, without whom I would have never discovered this film. I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in so long. On top of the great special effects and insane action, Last Action Hero offers a pretty clever satire of Hollywood cliches.","4612":"excellant","4615":"I don't hate this movie title but I hate the company who produce it. It is Mill Creek Entertainment. They almost removed all of the closed-captioning or English Subtitling features on DVD. I do not understand why the original DVDs companies have it and sell off to Mill Creek Entertainment by reducing some of the important features. Even they don't add booklet inside (chapters\/information). Whole thing is sucks! Try purchase original DVD of this title from Columbia\/Tristar DVD if available out there.","4616":"Cheesy as hell, but somewhat charming","4617":"great movie","4618":"A boy goes to see the latest Jack Slater (Arnold) movie. He gets a golden ticket and ends up in the movie.  Then Arnold and the baddie get hauled into the real world and it gets messy. Fun. Cameo appearances.","4620":"The Theatre sound was way too loud but I liked the idea of this movie and it's connection t5o other movies. A great Super Hero Comedy. I think Arnold has some spunk left in him yet!","4623":"Last action hero is only available fullscreen on dvd now it's back on blu ray 2 40 1 1080p it's theatical ratio so i had the dvd and it sucked in fullscreen so i got on blu ray now","4624":"Was about 13 when this came out and over 20 years later it still holds up.  This movie has it all acting, story, special effects and most important Arnold Brownswagger \"Movie Humor\"  in his prime.  It always strikes me as odd how this film rarely gets mentioned.  One of the last great action films to hit the big screen. If you have not seen it, now is the perfect time.  Stream it on Netflix while its up.","4626":"Arnold's performance embodied everything he's about - looking tough, lots of action, and best of all: He is the hero & nobody can stop him!","4627":"I really like Arnold S. I got this on time and all, but I did not quite like it as much as I thought I would.  Perhaps I need to watch it again...","4629":"Amazing blend of top-tier 90's action mixed with intelligent satire of the genre. McTiernan delivers one of the best Schwarzenneger flicks, in the prime of his career.","4630":"This is a crazy movie that Arnold Schwarzenegger made making fun of himself and his movies.  It's funny if you pay attention to the story of mixing the real world and the movie world.","4631":"Despite getting nominated for raspberry. This movie is still worth watching it has an awesome soundtrack in my opinion. It is funny if you like Arnold Schwazznegger movies.","4632":"You love Arnold, you love Action, you love cheesy one-liners, then you already know you love this movie as well","4633":"Much better than I was expecting.  Pretty funny and a blast to watch! Sons loved it and have watched d it over and over.","4634":"If you don't like Arnold Schwarzenegger movies then you don't deserve to like his movies at all and that's the truth.","4635":"what can I say, it`s good and some bad in it but its one you don`t mind watching over again","4636":"Mammoth sound, perfict picture. Exactly what I expected. I had the LD. and that format was impressive it was even better then the DVD. But the BluRay has them all beat.","4638":"Not a great movie but a very good classic comedy\/action movie. Entertaining for the whole family. Watch it and see how many scenes they borrowed from other popular movies of that time.","4639":"It's an action movie that makes fun of being an action movie, in a family friendly'ish way. It's very well done and I at least, still find it entertaining twenty years later.","4640":"Is anyone else having troubles with their prime streaming?  I use a Roku and Netflix works almost flawlessly.  Amazon Prime, however, completely bugs out whenever I try to pause and replay a movie.","4641":"The Last Action Hero Feb 18 2013\nAnother \"Big Arnie\" action movie, this one with some comedy! The nearly-2 hours moves quickly, lots of action and special effects! Usual bad guys die 20 times each!","4642":"It was funny and thought provoking  Acting was ok the stunts were good It was good to see Arnold in a different kind of role","4643":"Schwarzenegger plays a double role here, that of himself, and that of a movie character. But I won't say more for spoilers! A fine comedy well worth watching.\nThe movie arrived in fine time but the disc needed extra cleaning and buffing to play right, but it does.","4644":"This movie is great and highly underrated. It's full of great action and some really funny comedy as well. It may not be Arnold's best,but this movie is not to be taken seriously. Overall,if you are a fan of Arnold's or like a good action\/comedy then you will love this movie.","4645":"First time I've ever seen this movie, because I love Arnold.  I get all of the comical references, but would have liked the movie anyway if I didn't.  I usually hate movies that are older than 15 years, but this one is a gem.","4646":"Yaahh Aanold .\nArnold just simply rocks in any movie and this is one of them to add to your collection now Geth in da Choppaahh !","4647":"It's been 20 plus years since I've wateched this movie.  This movie has so many Hollywood insider references that I must confess I will never be able to appreciate them all.  I'll watch the reviews for those who can pin them all and I thank you.  The most tragic and poinent cameo is Ms. Maria Shriver's role.  Thank you for your governess, and much enjoyed movies, but I am sorry about your mistake...","4650":"great","4651":"I want to point out the video and the  audio transfer of this Blu ray movie are fantastic.\nAs for  the movie itself it is very entertaining and it is a nice pop corn family movie\nBuy it you will not regret it.","4653":"I am a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger\/action movie fan. I own almost all of his movies. Without being Arnold biased, this is a great movie. A very good story with lots of action. I highly recommend. Classic!","4654":"Last action Hero is a Awesome Movie. It has great action, funny one liners and a great cast and a great story. This movie is just toataly awesome. If You have not seen this movie then i recommedn you do.","4655":"It was nice to get the widescreen version of this film. I had an old standard aspect ratio and wanted the new\nfor my widescreen. This movie deliers for sure. Arnold at his best.","4657":"Here we are, closing in on 20 years after this movie's release and people STILL don't understand: this isn't an action movie, it's an action movie parody-basically one long in-joke. I saw this in a theater back in 1993 and loved it, because it wasn't meant to be taken seriously; it's Arnie lampooning himself (I'm Arnold Braunschweiger!) during his comedy movie era with other jokes tossed in. It doesn't always work, but it's great fun and this blu-ray was a long overdue re-release, even if it is bare-bones.","4659":"This film is a seventh-rate Terminator wannabe. The acting is secord-rate & over the top mainly with Lieutenant Dekker. The action scences are quite decent at best .The celebrity cameos are pointless. Some jokes were funny but not all of them. Not to metion,the lack of realism in the film's \"real world\" segment. I give this film a 2 and a half out of 10.","4662":"I liked having English SDH subtitles on this Blu-ray disc as the DVD version of this movie did not have them.","4672":"This is probably the most self-deconstructing film of all time (something that literary and film students could have a blast with) -- plus, it is action-packed and full of laughs. A winner!","4673":"It is neither your typical movie, nor Arnold's typical movie. It is silly, but pack with continuous action and comedy. So tune-up your expectations for a brainless, silly, and funny action-adventure film, and you can actually enjoy this one.","4679":"I love a lot of Arnold's movies but this movie is just a one time viewing.\n\nMy overall opinion a horrible movie, would have been great if it was actually funny.","4680":"Saw this movie on HBO and it was very cool. I like it when Jack Slater says to the bad guy at the end,\"No sequel for you\".Rated PG-13 for strong action sequences. Canada:14A.Great movie for the whole family.","4681":"This is, without doubt, Schwartzenegger's greatest movie.\n\nDon't get me wrong: I've enjoyed \"Pumping Iron\", \"Conan the Barbarian\", etc., but this has so much.  He's the hero, the anti-hero, the poker of ironical fun in action movie conventions, and he has a great supporting cast.  Charles Dance, in particular, just shines.  He's the perfect foil.","4682":"In my opinion, this movie has got to be Arnold's worst movie.  It was so stupid and boring, I turned it off 15 minutes into the movie.  I would give it NO STARS if I could!  Thank goodness Schwarzenegger's other movies make up for this turkey!  Definitely not worth renting let alone buying.  I would pass on this one.","4685":"saw this many times on tv\n\nloved it\n\nit was hilarious\n\ntouching and very powerful\n\nI like the acting\n\nthe scenery\n\nthe direction and directing\n\nI give all of Arnold's movies a chance\n\nbecause you can't always please everyone.\n\nand he did a good job on this in my eyes\n\nit's a classic comedy\/action movie and it's brilliant\n\nI got this on dvd now and will watch it again and again. it's just too memorable to forget a movie like this.","4686":"After a magical ticket blasts a young boy out of his seat and into the movie he's watching, his wildest fantasies come true -- battling the bad guys with his crime fighting hero.","4691":"This movie is 150 pounds of awesome in a 100 pound sack.","4692":"I love this movie, its like another version the Terminator series but hes not a machine. Get this movie, tons of action just like Terminator, if u liked T1,T2,T3 u will love this.","4693":"I don't see what people hate about this film. There are tons of awesome action scenes although they are a bit cheesy. The action is meant to be cheesy though because it's about a movie within a movie.\nThe cast is really good even though the boy seems a little annoying at first. By the end of the movie you will probably think Jack Slater to be really awesome. Anyways, I enjoyed it. There was humor, some one-liners, but the movie was extremely well done and extremely entertaining. 5 stars.","4696":"and Hamlet is taking out the trash!\n Jack Slater (Aronld) is a LA cop who is teamed up with Daniel Muggian.  Daniel is from OUR world, via a magical ticket that old Nick gave him.  Jack Slater is Daniel's hero.  There has been several Jack Slater movies, as we see that this is \"Jack Slater IV\"  that Daniel was watching when he enters the world of movies.\n  An Underated movie!","4698":"This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. Terrible plot, and all the co-stars can't act at all. A big budget movie that should have never been made. A giant black mark on Arnold's career.","4700":"this was one of my favorites back when I had it taped from television.  It is a sweet tale of the Muppets sharing Christmas together.  It is a classic tale for young and old.  Jim Henson always  had a way of reaching the  hearts of his viewers.  This video is no exception.  I look forward to  watching it every year","4701":"A young boy is thrown into the latest action film that stars his favourite fictional hero,Jack Slater,played by Arnold Schwarzennegger,both in the real film and in the film inside the real film...It's full of laughs and I'd have thought anyone with sense of humour would like it for what it is.","4703":"A good action packed film with Arnold Schwarzenegger! It's has good acting and the dvd was clear as a bell. It makes you think of what it would be like to have a fantasy hero come to life! If you like action movies this is a definite one to rent or buy!","4706":"I didn't see it when it was released in theatres, but I bought the VHS edition and my daughter and I laughed our butts off. I bought the DVD version for $10!! It's an Action\/Comedy and it's fabulous. I loved the smoke coming out of the chief's ears!! And Arnold's \"daughter\" is SO beautiful. Good choice, dude. I LOVED the magic ticket. I really enjoyed every bit of this movie. I've watched it several times already, and will watch it probably every year.","4709":"I honestly thought that Arnold was making fun of his own career in this movie it was that bad. ... Totally boring, unbelivable and wooden.","4710":"This is one of the top all-time underrated movies of all time.\nIt failed at the box office due to poor advance critic ratings. But what to real critics know?\n This movie is pure, classic Arnold, which a touch of fantasy thrown in!\n If you don't believe me, rent it first and see what I mean.  Then get back online and order this DVD.\n You'll agree with me I'm sure.","4712":"Muppet classic. If only the un-edited  cut were released.","4713":"it's okay","4714":"It`s the Muppets! what`s not to love?","4715":"This is the best Muppets Christmas movie!","4716":"good family movie","4718":"Truculent, unispired directed movie. The original idea was good, but was wasted while developing it. THi child is annoying, not a good actor at all.","4723":"I don't understand these comments, Last Action Hero is a spoof of the modern action film, that's why it's so corny and at times, badly made.  Both the director and Arnie himself explained this at length during the  promotion of the film but nobody seemed to understand.","4724":"Child actor Austin O'Brien steals scenes in THE LAST ACTION HERO, although his stand-out performance is not enough to make the film worthwhile.  Not that the filmmakers weren't trying to make a quality picture.  For effort,  THE LAST ACTION PICTURE tops a number of routine action flicks (COMMANDO,  ERASER) Arnold has made.  But by time the closing credits roll, THE LAST  ACTION HERO's slow moments outnumber its memorable ones.  Inspirational  line: \"It's what you make it.\"","4725":"An enjoyable Christmas Movie that involves a few different muppet worlds that are a part of the Henson reality.","4726":"a++++","4727":"My son had this when he was about 4 or 5.  We lost the vhs years ago, so I bought this again.","4728":"A VERY GOOD MUPPET MOVIE. I REALLY ENJOYED IT.","4729":"Love it. Everyone in family looks forward to seeing it every Christmas. Why is it not being made available by the producer?","4730":"Love this story with the original muppets.  All the songs and the caring and concern for each other.  Just a really nice - feel good movie.","4731":"great classic movie to watch over and over!","4732":"I had this on VHS, and that was gone when my player decided to eat the tape. People are right, there are songs missing, due to copyright issues I believe. Not all the songs are missing, but the major ones. I was disappointed, but because most of the movie is still true to form, not that disappointed. There's still enough of the original left that I was truly enjoying myself by the end. Pass It On is still on there., but Fozzy and the Snowman are not.","4734":"This gets brought out during the Christmas season, mostly. My kids and sometimes my wife, will watch it anytime of the year. Hey, it's the Muppets!","4735":"I lost my original copy of this movie in a hurricane so when I found it on amazon, I was beyond elated. it is truly the cutest little Christmas movies filled with the Muppet legacy. great music and funny jokes. definitely worth the buy.","4736":"this is a great dvd to buy it is out of print but a good dvd to buy by the late Jim Henson and his brother john Henson it has great songs like \"we need a little Christmas\" and \"caroling medley written by Jim Henson and \"pass it on by fraggle rock\" and all the  Muppet together as one on Christmas day.","4737":"Love the Muppets, This is one of the best (After the Muppet Christmas Carol). The un-cut way is the way to go. Look for that and remember when you were 6 watching this on TV. Watch out for the icy patch!","4739":"I love this kind of Muppet Special. I grew up watching this program. I think this one came out in 1987 or 88. This one is the best Muppet Christmas Special of all times because the cast of Sesame Street and Fraggle Rock was on there! I even use to recorded this on VHS, but the tape popped! But now I finally find this on Amazon! Now my nephews could enjoy it as well! Thanks Amazon for this VHS tape!\n\nDee Smalls\nRepresenting: Decatur,GA","4740":"I thought this was a sweet little movie, and enjoyed watching it over the holidays.  Being able to watch it on VHS made it all the more special for us.","4741":"Love this video.  I wish it were on dvd.  Fun Christmas times with the muppets and good music and laughter.","4743":"LOOKS GREAT. I WILL WATCH THE DVD tommarow.  IM AM VARY EXCITED. i am so happy i bought this dvd","4744":"When my kiddies were much younger, Sesame Street was a daily treat for them. As they grew older, they enjoyed the Muppet movies and seeing their familiar and favorite characters again. When the Muppet Family Christmas first aired on TV, we recorded it on our VCR, but it was a terrible print -- very fuzzy. To now have a DVD with a great copy of the show, we can enjoy it again with our kiddies and their kiddies.","4746":"This movie came out when I was 9, I had it recorded from TV on a VHS and my family and I would watch it every year during christmas. It became a must every year, it's funny and very entertaining, and it includes both The muppets and Sesame street!\nLast year my VHS broke, so that's why I had to buy the dvd. I love this christmas special, the last past is the best, when everyone sits in the living room and sing christmas carols. It's truly beautiful.","4747":"I was so happy to find this movie on Amazon, because it is hard to find (even though it's the best muppet christmas movie ever!)  Would recommend giving it a try if you haven't seen it, it's the perfect christmas movie for the whole family!","4749":"Rare item, great buy.  Good quality DVD makes the Muppets live forever.  Unlike Jim Henson.","4750":"I loved this movie as a kid. And I am so glad that I bought it now. Even though the scene with Fozzy Bear and the Snowman singing was cut, it still is a great DVD to own.","4751":"This is a very cute, very sweet Christmas special that brings the holiday spirit into your heart. How can you resist the Muppets, the Sesame Street gang, and the Fraggles all rolled into one Christmas Eve? Lots of singing and jokes to go around, it will become one of your favorites for that special month of December. (Or perhaps even more, as my 2-year-old nephew needs to watch it with every visit, regardless of it it's winter or summer!) A holiday classic for all ages.","4753":"We have been watching this for years.  Unfortunately, in the DVD version they've cut out a couple of songs and the comedy routine between Fozzie and the Snowman (Reindeer, SNOW Darling!) If those hadn't been cut this would be 5 stars for certain.\n\nWhy don't they re-release this intact?  All songs included and COMPLETE!  Look at the prices people are asking for the used versions.  Of course I wouldn't sell ours at twice the price.\n\nMom! Son!  AaaAaaaah!!!  Watch out for the Icy Patch!!!","4758":"Yes I still have my video copy of this special and I enjoy it this every holiday season! My favorite part is the holiday sing along part towards the end plus the cameo appearance by Jim Henson! This is still a great Christmas gem!!","4759":"This is one of Jim Henson's best.  This is a charming musical filled with just about every muppet Henson had made at that time.  The songs are timeless---\"Jingle Bell Rock\" and \"We Need A Little Christmas\" sounded as though they had been written just for this Muppet story.  If you have not seen this Muppet classic, it is well worth the money to own this enduring and charming story. If I should get stranded in a snow storm, I would be glad that it was with all my little furry friends.","4769":"I taped the original broadcast, and after watching it for many years, decided to buy a \"real\" tape of the program. I was very upset and disappointed to find they had cut what I considered some of the best parts of the film - and didn't even do a clean job of it. I do not recommend this to anyone who loves the original.","4770":"This is one of my favorite Christmas specials. Henson found a clever way to gather all of his different muppets together. The music is beautiful and memorable. The scenery is well done. Doc seems to step out of his brief roles in \"Fragile Rock\" well. Comical touches are even well placed. (Especially when poor Fozzie finds out that his own mother is friends with the two people who heckle him every chance they get.)","4774":"The second movie was far better than the first!\nHas a major twist in it too :)","4775":"I love this movie it go good with the first one","4777":"I think I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is an okay sequel and Jeffrey Combs is good in his minor role but Jennifer. Love. Hewitt.","4778":"not an amazing movie by any means but if you just want a by the books slasher movie then this is the movie for you.","4779":"Good exciting movie","4780":"i received the item in very good condition and it plays very good.","4781":"Thanks","4782":"One of my fave childhood films...that I had to add to my collection...","4784":"Good movie","4785":"An interesting sequel....good twist ending. Sad yet bittersweet when Ray had to pawn his ring for Julie to obtain a gun to go save her from potential death.","4786":"good movie, very exciting, but somewhat predictable, if you know the capital of Brazil is NOT Rio De Janiero. It is Brazilia.","4788":"Great edge of seat movie!","4790":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; I've learned that you can't always go by others opinion. Many don't like this movie however I enjoyed it. Watching it right now as a matter of fact.","4791":"Hmmm, how do you rate a movie you didn't get...? I got the First one instead...","4792":"Excellent condition","4794":"Excellent If I Bought It I Must have liked IT!","4796":"very good","4797":"Great slasher movie. Almost as good as the first but still a bit farfetched. Loved it. My kids seemed to enjoy it too.","4798":"This movie rocked. I watch it all of the time and it's not boring. The haters think this movie is stupid, well it's not. IT ROCKS BIG TIME","4800":"I like this one its my favorite out of the three.  Brandy is awesome ans Jennifer Love Hewitt is great! Got to see some eye candy too","4801":"great condition and received the movie faster then expected , this movie was a gift for my neice to complete her collection we were unable to find it anywhere around us, thank you :)","4802":"We ordered them all and watched them after they all came in. It came in on time so that's always a big plus to me.","4807":"this is a must see movie even if its 2011 its still good to watch now this is a great movie lots of screaming and action.","4809":"Blu-Ray is brand new.  Plays great.  Movie was shipped from back east and it took awhile to get here.  Still, I will buy from this seller again.","4813":"Wow. I loved this movie! I thought it was better than the 1st. No it wasn't really scary, but It kept me on edge! I felt sad Jennifer Esposito died. Aw[...] Anyway there wasn't a whole lot of blood but still enough. Check out this movie. One Thing,Brandy's butt looked big in those tight pants in the gym scene. I still love ya though Brandy!","4814":"it is a some what scary movie but i won't pee in my pants over it when i was ten i was scared but as i grew up it was as scary as i thought i would tell people to get it, it has a good plot but not very scary","4818":"This is one of my favorite films. The acting was real good,especially Brandy (What a surprise.)The ending was one of th best. The rain made it look like a real horror movie. Even though I do agree with a couple of other reviewers the movie was kind of rushed into production (I mean I never even heard of the guy who made it.)I still was pretty good. I'm only 13 don't get me wrong but I write my own stories and probably wouldn't thought of a better script.  [...]","4819":"Please if you think this is good horor then you don't know what good horror is, this movie along with the first one and even all of the Scream movies are garbage any real fan of cult horror or real horror will tell you don't wste your money. Real horror is made from the start of the first night of the living dead 1968 till about late 80's then from there horror quit is not wat it use to be.  \" I know what you did last summer \" is not good AT ALL","4822":"I know its bad ,cheesy and laughably unscary for a film that is supposed to be; but its so enjoyable that who honestly gives a damn?A perfect popcorn flick.","4823":"This isn't exactly the scariest movie ever or the most original, but it does have just about the best acting I've ever seen in a horror movie. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jennifer Espisito are great. Jack Black also does an excellent job. I definetly reccomend this show. It is an all around good time.","4824":"OK Since  this was a sequel, we all knew what was gonna happen. The man is gonna be coming back after her to kill her once and for all. But some how her and her girlfriend excape any major cuts or killings. Sometimes entertaining but not worth a watch.","4825":"I watch this all the time it plays on T.V I rent it sometimes. I think this one is a little bit better than the first one, they in Jamacia, yes its better. Jennifer Love Hewitt is just getting hotter and hotter, god I'll smack that ass. But this one is a worth watched horror film.","4848":"IT WAS AN OKAY MOVIE.  JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT, AND FREDDIE PRINZE JR. ARE BACK AND VERY GOOD IN THIS SEQUEL, BUT AS THEY SAY, SOME THINGS ARE BETTER LEFT ALONE.  SEQUELS ARE HARDLY EVER AS GOOD AS THE ORINGINAL.  THEY HAVE A GREAT TALENT BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.  I THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER IF THEY WEREN'T IN SUCH A RUSH TO PUT OUT A SEQUEL.","4853":"well, what to say about this trash other than \"Don't waste your time watching it like I did !! \"\" Movies like this are responsible for the bad reputation sequels generally have !! Irc !! Only Jennifer is amazingly pretty here, the rest is a screenplay so bad that the producers must be laughing until now ...","4855":"Even if you watch this as a comedy, you'll feel bad. You take an already weak plot from the original and throw away any merits it could have in this  lousy sequel. Jennifer is amazingly pretty, is the only point worthwhile  watching. The end was a bad joke. If they are trying to turn the killer  Will into another Jason, Freddy or Myers, it won't suceed.","4857":"I Still Know What You Did Last Summer is way bet- ter than the first one. It's completely different and surprsing. But it's not as scary as Scream or The Blair Witch Project. I liked it, and I recomm- end it.","4864":"i liked this one because it had a lot more violence.this one was definetely more scarier than the first one.the first one was just more of a mystery.this one is horror.i loved every minute of this","4866":"Main character is in college trying to forget about the events of the past year when she and a friend win a trip to the Bahamas and the killer from Part 1 enacts bloody revenge. Better than the first one, with breath taking  settings and some nice cliched heavy-violence. Popcorn, pepsi and pepsi.","4869":"You know, if they try to be like Friday the 13 movies with all the sequals, i would not be surprised that in 20 years, they make one where the stalker has alsymers disease and I think they should call it \"I DON'T  KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT SUMMER\" -Sometin' Kool","4870":"I still know...\nPros:\n*Cool direction.\n*Good screaming skills from the actresses.\nCons:\n*A little bit repetetive if you saw the first.\nThe bottomline:rent it and its predecessor when you have nothing  to do.","4871":"So, when a killer is on the rampage again what do you need? A holiday! But this holiday for Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt), Karla (Brandy), Tyrell (Mehki Phifer) and Will (Matthew Settle) is not gonna be relaxing! Ben  Willis (Muse Watson) has returned to Julie's life and wants her  dead.......again. Uh-oh. This flick is way scarier than the first and it  has a babe-licious cast!  Do not miss it!","4872":"The sole survivors from the first film win a  vacation to a tropical island. Here, they get stalked by the fisherman with the hook again. But this time he has a hook for a hand, which provides a but of atmosphere.  Still not that great, but not nearly as hopeless as it's made out to be.  Scary than the first, and a bit more entertaining.","4873":"Hewitt is in college and trying to get on with her life when her friend wins a trip for 4 to the Bohamas. There, they and a bunch of innocent bystanders are killed one by one by the killer from part I and his son.  Gets off to a great start, but falls into the rut of predictability with an  overdone body count.","4874":"Pretty good sequal to the original.  The only thing that was not good about it was the fact that it took away the mystery that the first one had.  More blood, more scare, and more cleavage than the first too!","4876":"very good movie even if it is dated.","4877":"Great movie thanks fast shipping too.","4878":"great film","4879":"I Have Always Loved Demi More Movies.\n\nThe Seventh Sign Is My Favorite !!\n\nIf You Have Never Seen The Seventh Sign, Give It A View.\n\nYou Might Just Like It !!","4880":"Very good movie.","4881":"I loved this movie","4882":"It came way faster than expected and was in perfect working condition considering how old the movie is. She was pregnant with Rumer in it. I watched it as soon as I got it (well, after a quick cleaning. The disc was kind of icky). Still love the movie and now I am going to go and thank the seller!","4883":"This movie is still great after all these years. The plot line is thought provoking and still relevant. Demi Moore is great. I enjoyed showing it to my teenage daughter who appreciated it as much as I always have.","4884":"great job as always","4885":"This is a great movie!  A little older but, all in all, good acting and a good plot.","4886":"My mom's been looking for this. She was excited when it arrived.  Thank you.","4887":"I have always loved this movie makes you think .\nI still live it good film about the end","4888":"NA","4889":"One of my favorite movies.","4891":"This movie gives you a small glimpse of the book of events in Revelations in the bible, and about the 7 signs prior to the second coming of Christ. Jrgen Prochnow did an excellent job as the character of \"David Bannon\" ( aka Jesus ) if you see the picture of Akiane Kramarik's \"Prince of Peace\" and see the movie ( or look up Jrgen Prochnow from 25 years  ago, ) You'll find the resemblance striking. This movie will truly make you think.","4892":"Oldie but a goodie...","4893":"Great movie","4894":"Great movie","4895":"Like it","4896":"I like this movie.  I'd say it falls in the religious or metaphysical realm, and it's a story that's been told many times in multiple formats.  Demi Moore is believeable, and Jurgen Prochnow is fantastic, as always.  It really doesn't give the details that most of the other stories do...almost as if discussing a religious story might be so offensive to the movie watchers, that they prefer to avoid almost all of the actual biblical lore.  It's a nice movie for a quiet evening, but it's really not that deep.","4897":"ok","4898":"Love this story of apocalyptic occurences. It has Biblical references with some embelishment and literary license. A young married couple experience events described in the Book of Revelation. Mysterious and Thrilling.","4899":"Interesting.","4900":"Great movie!","4901":"For me just a good not gory supernatural movie","4902":"The ONLY Movie I will EVER like:>{very Much}, with Demi Moore in it.  May touch your soul?...I Hope\nROCK ON!, and God Bless","4903":"Received the movie yesterday and watched it as fast as I could open it! It is still as wonderful as I remember it and a terrific addition to a collection! Well acted, well directed , great camera shots. Moviemakers today should take note!","4904":"Thoroughly enjoyed ... captivating til the end","4905":"love this movie","4906":"did not work, tried it in both of my DVD players it gave me a disk error","4907":"I'm a big Demi Moore fan. She does an awesome job in this movie. Love it.","4908":"This movie hold now Biblical truth, I was very disappointed in it.","4909":"Classic !!!!","4910":"One of my favorite all-time movies.  It will take some time to get used to the \"Jesus\" in this movie if you've seen  'Das Boot' the same way that the soundtrack of  'Caligula'  kept me from enjoying \"The Hudsucker Proxy\" by having flashbacks from the former movie every time Hudsucker's theme played.  Why do film-makers do THAT!?  As for the movie's message, when it comes to Albuquerque:  \"DON'T Forgive Them, Lord, They Know EXACTLY What They're Doing!\"  lol","4911":"Demi gave an awesome performance! Very good story.","4912":"Good movie, Ive always liked these type of movies. I know its not the best movie ever, but its worth watching.","4913":"great","4914":"Pretty good!","4915":"Good Movie!","4916":"Great movie","4917":"Very well done and great acting.","4918":"LOVE THIS MOVIE","4919":"I just enjoy watching The Seventh Sign. It's not the best movie ever made but it's entertaining and a far cry better than today's reality crap.","4920":"Very satisfied","4921":"Very good film about The Rapture, quite frighting.","4922":"excellent DVD - exactly as described - fast quality shipping !!","4924":"A good movie to watch when in the mood for the scary.","4925":"Great..super fast delivery!","4926":"Good movie!","4927":"Great classic fantasy, spiritual, scary flick. Definitely dated, but still very enjoyable. Should you have the chance, check this one out!","4928":"This hautingly spiritual and thought provoking movie will stir your soul.","4929":"Excellent -  Item delivered on time, was as described,","4931":"Well played by good old Demi.","4932":"I really enjoy this movie. I'm glad I was able to find it on DVD for such a reasonable price.","4933":"~Love this movie so much~Ordered because my other one has worn out~Prompt delivery~THANK YOU!!","4934":"Pretty cool end of times movie","4935":"OK","4936":"AAAAAA","4937":"This tape will bring tears to your eyes. I know I cried and the copy that I got is clear and you can hear what is going on.","4938":"This movie was different, but fairly interesting. I love to study  prophecy, so that is what drew my attention. Some of the information was new to me, so I am not sure of the reliability of the content.","4939":"Loved this movie when I first saw it. I enjoyed revisiting it. I like the biblical references that make you really think about how you are living your life. I love the message of hope in the ending.","4940":"i just love this tape so must it is great i just love to watch it thank you so must","4941":"This was a good movie for thinking about possibilities and what if's, left me with a sense of believing that one person can make a difference, if they pay attention to the signs, what they come to mean and doing something about it. Suggest everybody to view it and see for themselves, it's not so big of a stretch from reality. I really enjoyed it.","4942":"Such a good movie - oldie but a goodie.  I used to watch it all the time as a kid so watching it as an adult is a bit of a head trip.","4943":"We just re-watched this and it really held up. Very interesting, and although it doesn't get all the facts right, we have to remember that it's a fictional story that sparks conversation about the end of days.","4944":"When i recieved the package the cd was moving in the case, as i opened it there was scratches on the cd so i will take it for repair to be buffed out. i really and truly thank you all for the movie have been looking for it for years, its not your fault it was how the handled the package but i am very pleased to say i will order from you all very soon.. thank you so very much.","4946":"It is great!, Great story, great acting...very acurrate historically and inspirational to watch.  Loved all the characters and I thought it was super throughout.","4948":"Was a slow movie drama, whithout more action. Present a beautiful message to encrease the faith. But with low dramatic end.","4949":"I thought this was very good. This was one of Demi Moore's that did she did not get a lot of credit for.  All actors were very good.","4950":"on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much","4951":"This is a  must watch over and over movie. I watched it with my kids & they loved it. We finally got around to watching it & they really enjoyed it.","4952":"This is a great 80's movie.  This is one they should consider re-making ---- with today's special effects,  it would be really good","4954":"Thi move while the story is ridiculous is good entertainment, Demi Moore stunning. I don't like being told howm many words I should use in my review so now I bet I have hit the minimum.","4958":"I am very pleased with my purchase. It was sent very quickly and in great condition.  I will buy from this company again. Love the series.","4959":"Not true to the Bible, but I enjoyed this older movie anyway.  I would recommend it to everyone if you haven't ever seen it.  I had seen it in the past and decided I wanted to own a copy of it.","4961":"i bought this movie in fye store on sale for only a few dollars. im glad i bought it. i read the back cover of the dvd in store and said hmmmmm this looks pretty good. and boy was i right. i watched it on my dvd player and i cried at the very end. sometimes a sad movie will make me tear but this one actually made me cry.great flick.","4964":"another collectable for me.  You just don't see movies like this anymore.","4966":"Great movie","4967":"Good quality","4968":"I really Enjoyed this movie . about the last days Demi More plays a wife thats suicidel\nfrom losing her last baby and feels over stressed and worried about losing this one ..\nShe goes through the tramma of the last days hoping to stop the the events of the end\nof the world and Judgement ... I am going to buy this movie as I only rented it ..","4970":"A young couple, expecting their first child, are told tales by one of their tenants that frighten the wife, who believes they may be prophecies concerning their unborn child. This movie is very suspenceful and will grip you where you would not expect it to. Hopefully, you will see the need to appreciate the gift of love that is offered not just in this movie but in everyday life. A guaranteed tear jerker and this movie will blow you away.","4971":"This is a great mystery movie.  I have watched it many times.\n\nIt will keep you interested the entire time...so get your cola and your popcorn BEFORE the movie because you will NOT want to break your focus to catch all of the clues.  This is one of those \"keeper\" movies.  You'll probably have to buy another one later because you'll wear this one out!\n\nI have worn out my copy and will have to buy another.","4972":"I had forgotten how entertaining this movie was.  I saw it years ago and just happened to catch it again on FEARNET.  Yes, it's a Demi Moore 80's classic and yes the eyewear in this film reminds me of whay I always wore contacts then, but it is actually pretty good.  I hadn't seen it in so long. I didn't remember very much of it.  It's a pretty fun, tense, fast-paced religious apocolyptic thriller.  You could find many worse ways to spend and hour and a half.","4975":"Watched this movie when I was very young and I still get a kick out of it each time I watch it.  I did not have surround sound back then but to hear the  jets flying and the explosions just makes me want to keep watching the Iron Eagle.","4976":"I watched this movie years ago. When I saw it in the CD list, I knew I had to buy it. I could never get tired of this movie, ever though hopefully it could never happen by a group of kids.","4977":"This came out I think around the time time as Top Gun.  And was overshadowed by it.  You just have to watch the movie.  It's good on it's ow.  You just have to tell yourself it's just a movie.  Because most of the plot is unbelievable,  The acting by Lou Gossett Jr. is good.  And I just watched Executive Decision yesterday.  And David Suchet is a good as a terrorist.","4978":"great movie with the best from deniro and scorsese, just as described very great quality","4980":"Still holds up after all these years, and just a relevant as it was when it first came out.","4982":"Iconic film and performance. Tons of extra features. Great price, plus digital code.","4984":"muy buena versin en bluray","4985":"Cannot find a better copy of this movie on disc.","4986":"Heard a lot about this movie.  Finally broke down and watched it.  I really didn't like it, It really didn't make any sense and it dragged to much for me.  I thought it was to slow and boring.","4987":"Classic Movie.  I need to add the 40th Anniversary Edition to my collection.  Great Price.","4988":"classic","4989":"Its a great movie. I recommend","4990":"Very atmospheric and well acted depiction of the sordid world of New York's Time Square forty years ago.  Beautifully photographed.\n\nA little slow getting started, and a couple of the sub-plots are unnecessary and therefore do not move the story forward.\n\nThe relatively happy ending for the central character is not believable, and contrasts with the noir tone of the rest of the film.\n\nAbout twenty minutes should have been cut from the final version.","4991":"My favorite movie of all time","4992":"add to my collection.","4993":"Great movie","4994":"Good movie i really like it","4995":"Demi Moore's tortured screams of \"Noooo! Noooo!\" at the end of this garbage heap of a film were very appropriate, since that is exactly what I was thinking after realizing I had wasted 90 minutes of my life on this incomprehensible nonsense.","4999":"OK teen movie","5000":"While this film came out a few months before Top Gun, it was a hit when it was showcased. Then, Top Gun quickly eclipsed it. With a great '80s soundtrack, it is time to give this flying movie another pass.","5001":"Let's hear it for Louis Gossett and the young hero.","5002":"Great old movie from the 70s thank you for fast shipping.","5003":"A great movie.  A cab driver, ex-marine, takes on mobster white slavers and rescues an enslaved 12-1\/2 year-old girl to become a hero to all.  Before its time, if anything.  Even the politics subplot would be cutting-edge today.  I missed it frst time around; I'm glad I watched it now.  I would have included Cybill Shepherd in the Oscar nominations, ,though.  DeNiro and Foster deserved theirs.  Good streaming quality\n\nJim","5006":"Was Ok.","5007":"Very well made.  When you watch this movie, you feel like you are in NYC in the 1970's. It is so realistic it's scary. It wasn't a very nice city back then.","5008":"Another Great Drama Movie. Glad to have added this to My Collection. This is Robert De Niro in His younger day's.","5009":"Strange film","5010":"A film that fails to overcome the fact that it stars Demi Moore.  Nonsensical hocus-pocus pseudo-biblical script. (Hint: pick up the Book of Revelations while you watch the flick, and see how much they get wrong.)  Awful acting, clanking dialogue.  Just drags on and on and on....","5014":"Saw this years ago, watched it with my son again, and it's still weird and strange...but interesting.","5015":"Excellent!","5017":"Great movie","5018":"Good entertainment and a great start to the series of movies. Young folk need to think well b\/4 embarking on such rescue missions.","5019":"really like this movie","5020":"This movie was a lot better than I expected. I learned about it after reading \"Ready Player One\" by Ernest Cline. The dog fights could easily rival those of Top Gun. The story focuses on a teenage boy that has had flight training in Air Force jets complements of his pilot father. The bullying and typical teenage whining, I could have done without, but it took away little from the overall story. It was well done throughout, and I've added it to my permanent collection of re-watchable movies.","5021":"Love this movie very much.","5022":"bought it for the wife and she loved it.","5024":"Excellent","5025":"Not much to say that hasn't been said elsewhere so I'll just add that this looks great on blu-ray.  This is probably my favorite movie and I never get tired of watching it.","5026":"depressing","5027":"What isn't good about this movie. Intelligent, brutal, and flawlessly done. If you haven't seen it and only know Scorcese from his Leo movies you are missing Scorcese '9who is still fantastic) back in his lean and mean days. Back when DeNiro was a force of nature. Hermann's last score. Schrader's best screenplay.","5028":"A must-see classic.","5029":"another of my favorite movies what a great edition with all the extras thanks for getting it to me so quickly","5030":"A favorite of mine.","5031":"Great HD version of this classic 80's movies.","5032":"Classic movie, if you live in a major city, we all feel like going crazy sometimes.","5033":"This brief review is for the 40th Anniversary Nov 8, 2016 product release, not just another countless movie opinion.\nBE WARNED: This item DOES NOT come with the \"post cards\" that are pictured with some of the earlier reviews.\nIt DOES NOT even come as pictured, with the protective card board cover sleeve.\nJust a plain BluRay case with the 2 discs and the Digital HD card.\n     for the actual movie...","5034":"Great watching this again!","5035":"Great, great movie.","5036":"Deniro finest performance","5037":"Brand new & shipped quickly.","5038":"A classic movie collector must have.","5039":"GOAT movie","5040":"Classic Entertainment!  The music and characters make this movie a classic. I know it's not realistic for Dad's son and one other to joy ride two F16s and create their own foreign policy, but this story is a lot of fun. I simply enjoy watching it.  It also came from a time when we wern't so invaded by technology.  So every once n a while I like to watch this. After all these years it's still worth looking at, so that by itself must mean something.","5041":"this movie is ranked in top ten of must see if you are into modern day military jets F-16 migs are not migs , plus there is no mig 23  .","5042":"Great!!!!!","5043":"One of my favorite movies. Very hard to find on DVD.","5044":"The classic that is fantastic... it's no top gun, but it doesnt try to be. This is a kids fantasy movie set in real life.\n\nGreat fun for anyone who misses the 80s.","5045":"Always a fun movie to watch...classic 80's","5046":"Punk DeNiro should be  shunned by decent Americans.\nHe wanted to be political so here WE are being political back.\nThe only good flick he ever made was Ronin anyway.","5047":"As good today as it was 40 years ago. The blu-ray treatment is excellent.","5048":"Finally watched it.  Good entertainment.","5049":"Love this film. This film was Deniro's and Scorsese's 2nd work together, and they shine in it like a million suns, and great work in her debut film role by Jodie Foster, as the lost and confused 12 year old prostitute. From beginning to end, this one sizzles like a campfire that won't go out.","5050":"depressing","5051":"Are you talking to me?","5052":"Great movie.","5053":"great","5054":"came in perfect condition on arrival","5055":"Classic must see movie!","5056":"An incredible Blu Ray transfer for one of my favorite movies of all time. Highly recommended.","5057":"A classic","5058":"WHY IS THIS NOT ON BLU-RAY YET?  This one should get the full 4K UHD anniversary release imo.  Another timeless fav classic.","5059":"The climax was weak","5060":"Amazing movie ! Amazing service!","5061":"fine","5063":"Bought for my son. He loves this movie!","5064":"Fun movies!!!!!!!","5065":"Need more of these movies.","5066":"One of the best movies of all time!","5067":"One of the few military stories I really like.","5068":"Classic \"rebellious youth save the day\" film of the '80s.","5069":"Not something I want to watch again soon.  Love the scene with the psycho cab passenger and the one where de Niro takes that stuck up bh to a porn movie.  Totally sick.","5070":"Overhyped and overrated.  Just ok.  Drags, tedious.","5071":"Interesting movie.","5072":"Great old movie for my collection.","5073":"great","5074":"We enjoyed this movie when it originally came out.  It was fun to watch although pretty unrealistic in this day and age.","5075":"love it","5076":"I really enjoy the story of this movie,  I liked everything about it except all the cussing and taking the  Lord's name in vane.  This for me ruined the entire movie,  Even though I liked the plot and the characters in it, it is one that I am going to return.. I would have given 5 stars\nif the cussing and taking the Lord's name in vane wasn't in there.","5077":"In the mood for 80's nostalgia? Rent or purchase this \"Check Your Brian out the Door\" movie. Great popcorn flick with questionable model effects for the dogfight scenes of its era. Acting is top notch 80's caliber. Great Father and Son movie!!","5078":"Great product just as described","5079":"One on the greatest cult movies during my generation.","5080":"Classic","5081":"Just so so","5082":"Iron Eagle is one of our favorite old movies which we had on VHS. We decided to go ahead and replace the VHS movies with DVDs. Shipping was fast and the movie quality is excellent!","5083":"I love the Iron Eagle movie series, I've ordered all four movies to complete my collection. Corny & really unbelievable, unrealistic plot. But entertaining.","5084":"Excellent","5085":"Classic","5086":"GOOD MOVIE BUT THEY DO NOT CONNECT TO INTERNET. CHECK THEM SO NO ONE ELSE CONPLAINS  MR.B","5087":"excellent","5088":"One of the great films. The amazing great cast, and director make this a must have film.","5089":"Excellent acting for all but not deep enough story. Could have been more to it, I think. Good photography.","5090":"Food for a 1970s movie. DiNiro always great.","5091":"Finally, I completed my collection... cool......  they were all good except that #3 way too much inuendo, sex and T&A. would you believe I thru it away? Yep a did.. but I have the others and enjoy them a lot.  JB","5092":"Great movie","5093":"works great","5094":"a great yanks kick ass movie.","5095":"The movie was good. mild action; but, quit tastful.","5096":"A little on the weird side but it definitely had a deeper meaning as a whole in the end. Deniro shines in this role though.","5097":"Is a must watch but, not good at all","5098":"brutal","5099":"good","5100":"I have seen this a couple times and have now the entire collection.  Good clean\nentertainment for the whole family.","5101":"This is the best movie the Air Force has to offer??? A high school kid managing to steal an F-16????","5102":"Good movie - finally found a purchased i.","5103":"Good Movie.","5104":"damaged dvd, did not play it until I had had it for a while, so just sucked it up as a loss","5105":"Love this movie because it has Jason Gedrick in it. I like all his movies.","5106":"great job","5107":"Dear Niro, what more can you say.","5108":"This is one of those truly great movies that pass through the test of time.....40 years and still a great movie!!!! Among The best from De Niro with Cape Fear and Angel Heart, and that means a lot because he is one of the greatest actors ever......Completely recommended if you like brutal movies!!!!","5110":"always a good movie with Louis gossett","5111":"For my husband who loves this movie! He loves it! Good price.","5112":"great classic movie","5113":"Good movie but was surprised of all of the four letter words.  I only had seen it on TV","5114":"GREAT FOR MY COLLECTION I LOVE IT...100%","5115":"classic","5116":"Great product and fast shipping!\nCouldn't be happier.","5117":"Sorry but I'm glad I did not see this when it was released. DeNiro and Foster are awesome actors but not in this movie. Save your money and get one of their recent releases, much better.","5118":"Bought this for my husband and he was very pleased. If you are a De Niro fan, then this movie is a must see.","5120":"saw this when it was first released.  It is still powerful today.","5121":"I watched this movie on tv the first time. I wanted to watch it on DVD and its so much better than on tv.","5122":"Always loved this movie mostly because of the great flight scenes...I could watch them forever.  Enjoyable movie featuring the great Lou Gossett, Jr. and a very young Jason Gedric who decide to rescue his father who has been taken captive in the middle east.  Great action film which is enjoyable for all ages.","5123":"Love the music and story.","5124":"my husband wanted this again since he dropped his and broke it. didn't take long to get another. shipper was quick and prompt.","5125":"thank you","5126":"Maybe this film just doesn't age well. Or maybe it's just not very good. One star is too high.","5127":"Great quality disc and box! And as for the film itself; a classic! MUST WATCH.","5128":"Well done","5129":"Like Robert DeNiro  I like the Action","5130":"Love this movie. Lots of action and great music.  If you like Lou Gossett Jr. this is a must see.","5131":"Just plain silly. A teenager (Jason Gedrick) learns that\nhis Air Force dad has been shot down and taken prisoner\nby Middle-Eastern terrorists. What does he do?  Why, he\ngets a retired officer (Louis Gossett) to help him steal\na fully armed jet so he can go rescue his dad himself.\nNegative Ghost Rider, the pattern is full.","5132":"Mom specifically asked for the first one in this series as I had the second one. One of the good ones for Louis Gossett, Jr.","5133":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I love Jason. He is a very taliented actor. Louis Gossett is also very special.","5135":"great classic movie","5136":"Liked...very period.","5137":"The 4K really is 100% better than the regular movie, was like watching it for the first time.  Never get tired of this classic film.","5138":"I can't believe it only in Full Screen! No widescreen version. I love the movie, but now that I have an HDTV....","5140":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Iron-Eagle\/dp\/0767827686\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Iron Eagle<\/a>\nThis is a real enjoyable movie all the way thru. It keeps you on the edge of your seat during the fighter pilot scenes. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I can't wait to see the sequil to it.","5142":"Iron Eagle should receive 5 stars \"hands down!\" It's fast paced, high energy; I couldn't sit still! I even turned on my  speakers for great amplification, wow!  This is a great hero movie with plenty of action, and hits every emotion. Not one dull moment  in the movie.  I highly recommend it!","5146":"Iron Eagle has always been one of my favorite movies. If you are looking for a movie with  a lot of blood and gore, you will not find it here. What you will find is a lot of action and great flying scenes","5147":"This is a great movie.  Our little one likes to watch it a lot.  Arrived just as seller said it would.  Thanks","5154":"I hadn't watched this movie in many years so wanted to see it again. Amazing filmmaking and it was just as good as I remembered it to be.","5155":"as advertised","5156":"A classic  movie,","5157":"4k OK great movie","5159":"Gritty realism that is gripping but with a phony ending.","5163":"I just finished the book, Killing Reagan and I wanted to see how a movie could make John Hinckley want to kill Reagan.  It did not have that effect on me.  It made me want to kill myself for a waste of two hours and 15 bucks.  I would not recommend the movie nor trying to figure out a crazy person's motivation.  I highly recommend the book Killing Reagan however.","5164":"Iconic.","5165":"A classic and some one liners people use today that put this movie on the map.","5166":"Interesting through both its character development - De Niro as the taxi driver - and cinematography. Very slow at times, especially past the mid-point of the movie. Historically interesting as the movie that initiated John Hinkley's obesssion with Jodie Foster and eventually led him to attempt to assassinate President Reagan.","5168":"Movies like this are a disgusting tribute to the filth and perversion that seems to be prevalent in our major cities.  I wish I could \"unsee\" it.","5169":"Good Stephen King","5170":"Just love it. See Travis was not so crazy, Robert De Nero was wonderful. I did notice that you left a small part when he shaved his head.","5171":"Great film, of course, if a little dated (gun violence is so prevalent now that the younger generations are virtually inured to it).  This film loses one star due only to its presentation on Amazon Prime.  It's certainly not in high definition and the colors are even darker than Scorsese could have intended.","5172":"historical","5174":"Fast, Fair, As Advertised!","5175":"I love Wes Anderson's movies, he is one of a kind!! I recomend any of his movie, you will love them if you are not a \"normal person\".","5176":"wes Anderson is amazing","5177":"good dark movie","5178":"As advertised. I recommend this seller.","5179":"Stopped watching after just a few minutes.  Boring.","5180":"Thought it was one of the worst films I've ever seen. Stupid Stupid Stupid","5181":"Excellent!","5182":"arrived as promised - luv  Wes Anderson","5183":"Called a classic for a reason! Brilliantly written, acted, and directed.","5184":"A must see. Visually stunning. Classic deniro","5186":"Terrific!","5187":"Great film, unless you need gag humor and explosions to entertain you. Might be my all time favorite movie.","5188":"but so far great movie","5189":"Feels like you want to cuddle up with this movie","5190":"simply the best.","5191":"I lived in NYC a few months around this time.  The movie scared me.  I knew the city was like this, but never had the bad experiences.  Probably the best movie of the period.  And the best display of what we now call PTSD.","5192":"Like an American version of Camus's The Stranger, it perfectly captures the existential feelings of living in a big metropolis.","5193":"iI's a movie with many good actors whom were very young.  I like seeing how they acted years ago and comparing them to present times.","5194":"It was better than some and not as good as alot of movies","5195":"A slap stick comedy.","5196":"This is the original Wes Anderson film and the first roles for the Wilson brothers, too.  So, just from a film history point of view, it's worth seeing, but it is also really a good movie, with a really nice love story sandwiched into the plot.","5197":"never grabbed me. love luke and owen but got lost in this one.","5198":"great movie with a youn de niro .  classic de niro.","5199":"Incredible acting by Robert De Niro and Jody Foster. Compelling gritty story, flawed only by the ending.","5200":"great","5201":"ok","5202":"Not much of a story in this movie","5203":"A good story about strange guys doing the best they can and still failing and remaining good friends through adversity. Good acting and never boring.","5204":"I had never seen it before but was familiar with the plot.  What a horribly boring and slow movie, I got through it but would never recommend it to anyone.","5206":"kinda boring","5208":"Very entertaining.","5210":"One of my favorite movies","5211":"classic","5212":"Good quality","5213":"Had Seen several times before but I never get bored watching. I love DeNiro!  Great movie!","5214":"ok","5215":"Robert de Niro is a good actor, but the movie itself is just OK","5216":"enough said","5217":"good movie","5218":"Wes Anderson, what a talent!","5219":"The Pop art idea being implemented into the steelbook market,  is great (as long as it is in good taste). I don't think I need say nought about a Great cult classic as TAXI DRIVER TOP NOTCH.  The artwork is great keep it up, it gives a personal touch to the steelbook market!. But really with that crazy mow hawk hair cut, looking into the mirror saying...","5221":"Love this movie","5222":"De niro doing what he does best.  The movie that helped put Foster on the movie scene very bright and mature for her albeit small part.  Lots of other stars  even Scorsese has a part.  Watch this movie for no other reason than to understand when people make references to it. Cerebral and dark in places but captures the essence of the setting and time period.","5223":"This is a well-known movie starring Robert De Niro, with Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and other stars. De Niro is a lonely and depressed former Marine, now driving a taxi in N.Y.C. He pursues a hopeless relationship with a presidential campaign worker (entirely different backgrounds and interests), but does manage to save Jodie Foster from a continued life as a prostitute. He's hailed as a hero, encounters Cybill again as a fare, but nothing grows out of it. Too long, FAR too slow - boring.","5224":"Its hysterical. For a long time I could never see without thinking of Dignon.","5225":"It's funny but this is the least of my favorites of Wes Anderson movies. It's an early one of his work. It has his humor and worth seeing but there's better ones of his movies out there!!","5226":"Good","5227":"gave this as a gift to my son who is a Will Ferrell fan","5228":"not W. A.'s best.","5229":"This was a gift to a family member. I see them re-playing it from time to time, and their comment is that they really liked it.","5230":"A Classic - 70s in New York before the Yuppies and tourists took away all charm.  Hats off to Joe Spinell my old friend who plays DeNiro's boss","5231":"Sorrsese got this one right. DeNiro plays the mysterious Taxi Driver. You know something bad is going to happen but you just don't know what. Great twist at the end leaves you scratching your head, I could not stop watching.","5232":"Classic De Niro. I think everyone can find something to connect with, and while not totally politically correct, Travis Bickle can make a lot of sense.","5233":"What a downer.","5235":"Good, not great.  Plot has its moments.  But doesn't quite succeed.","5236":"I really expected more out of this movie...  I guess I should have listened to the other reviews.  I kept waiting for it to get funny or interesting... I really wanted to like, in the end, it was a waste of 1-1\/2hrs of my life.","5237":"It was good and interesting, obviously a very early and raw Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson creation. Good movie for a taste of their early work.","5238":"Interesting to see how Wes Anderson started and had developed since this movie","5239":"Thanks","5240":"Taxi Driver is an excellent movie.  Even though some people complain that it is slow moving, it kept my attention which usually doesn't happen when I watch movies.  There was a lot of attention to small details, which was important and added a lot to the movie.  It raises some difficult questions which aren't really addressed, but that's a sign of a good movie - it gets you to think about your own thoughts and answers to the movie and the situations presented.  I think it is an excellent film.","5241":"The best","5242":"Well, I've always heard about this movie and it is rated one of the top 100 movies of all time...finally watched it and I am not exactly sure why!  I mean, Robert Deniro did a very good job and Jodie Foster was not really even in as many scenes as I thought she was going to be.  Not the worst movie I have ever seen and definitely not the best!","5243":"The Martin Scorsese classic is gorgeous in 1080p hi-def. A must own for any film buff. Deniro is brilliant. Five stars.","5244":"slow moving and boring","5245":"Me like!","5246":"okay","5247":"Luke Wilson is a talented comic actor but you would never know that by watching this movie.  The jokes are stupid, the characters are idiotic and the story is just awful.","5248":"just learning to appreciate wes anderson, i didn't even realize until the film was almost over that i was really enjoying it!","5249":"Dreary movie and disjointed. Can't believe it was nominated for best picture!","5251":"One of the best movies ever!","5252":"kind of bloody and weird","5253":"classic movie  classy service","5254":"Not worth my time","5255":"Not a bad show. Worth the watch","5257":"There are SEVEN movies in this set:\n\nHigh Anxiety,\n\nHistory of the World, Part 1,\n\nYoung Frankenstein,\n\nSilent Movie,\n\nRobin Hood : Men in Tights,\n\nThe Twelve Chairs,\n\nTo Be or Not to Be\n\n....and they are each hilarious.  This set is a classic!","5258":"We all need movies, close at hand, that will make us laugh and fall off the chair!!  That is what Mel Brooks does for me.  So if you like funny, spoofy, sometimes silly and filled with inuindos, you will love this collection too.  The description doesn't list it but Young Frankenstein is also in this collection.","5259":"have left out The Producers, Mel's first and probably always foremost! better to pay 50 brooksaroos for that film and 10 only for this box of dreck (relatively schpeaking)","5260":"They did a great job with the blu ray edition, I love this movie!","5261":"A classic that you shouldn't miss.","5262":"Excellent movie with a surprise ending. LOVED IT!! De Niro is absolutely fabulous!!","5263":"Excellent price, great product, fast shipper.  Thanks\nJohn.","5264":"I don't like it.\nbob","5265":"Until now,i have never ever seen a W.A film I did not love and was surprsied when I not only did not like this one but actually found it\nboring and solopistic.  ah well, can't win them all!","5266":"I didn't get to finish watching it!","5267":"Boring.","5268":"Wonderful treatment of this historic film","5269":"DeNIRO!","5270":"This is one of the best movies of all times.","5271":"A must view oldie...kudos to the seller too","5272":"Finally on Blu Ray. De Niro at his best. Are you talking to me? Are you talking to me? I can watch this over and over. Are you listening to me?","5273":"Classic","5274":"One of the all time classics for me. I had this one on VHS, but no longer have a VCR. I have a Blu-ray player and it plays DVD's just fine. I wanted this one for my collection of De Niro films.","5276":"The Royal Tenenbaums is my favorite film. I love all of Mr. Anderson's other installations. I want to be Bill Murray when I grow up. That said, I took a long, sweet nap 20 minutes into this movie. Could be I was tired. Could be this wasn't my cup of tea. I'll try again.","5277":"I thought it was really slow paced, and not too interesting","5278":"boring","5279":"De Niro is always terrific.  Not completely happy the way it ended.","5280":"It is good","5282":"Nice!!!","5283":"Do not understand how I put off seeing it for so long--finally had to be nudged by my grandchildren.","5284":"TERRABLE PICTURE, VERY BORING","5285":"It was different and at time s very funny.","5286":"I could only make it through 5 minutes. I'll never get those minutes back!","5287":"Just plain lame. Not funny.","5288":"The acting is superb in this movie, DeNiro's first. I think it is must see for Robert De Niro fans. I don't know if the end would go over so big today though . Rent it and see for yourself","5290":"I think that everyone has seen Taxi Driver.  DeNiro in is younger days a a young tough in NYC stands alone against those in the wrong (Harvey Keitel), because he took a shining to young Jodi Foster, the underage hooker.  Definitely a classic with superb acting all of the way through.  For those who haven't seen it.  You don't know what you're missing.","5291":"What did they do to TAXI DRIVER? I was excited to order the 4K version. I immediately put it on my 4K Blu Ray player to watch on my new 70 inch 4K TV.  What a waste of time and money. I don't know what mastered copy of the film they used for this version, but it's a total bust.\nGrainy, no sharpness, even the colors seem slightly muted. DO NOT BUY. I'd return it, but can't since I've already opened the package.","5292":"Okay","5293":"it was OK for free, sure glad I didn't pay for it. I don't like James Caan in the first place but I am very happy he only had a cameo.\nSo we have boys who go to prison & the mental hospital get our, commit crimes and go back to same. In between\none meets a nice Ecuadorian lady who looks like she just came from Spain. There is no discernable plot except crime doesn't pay.","5294":"nice movie","5295":"good","5296":"Love the movie","5297":"Another great blu-ray remaster for Scorsese.  the maestro done right.","5298":"classic!! Deniro+Scorsese=brilliance!!!","5299":"Question - So what are the differences between this set and the other (non-deluxe) Mel Brooks Blu Ray set?  Just the book and the hardshell box?  Anything else that's substantial?  It's hard to tell by the description.","5300":"My son-in-law loved this. It was one gift he was totally surprised to receive.","5301":"Great collection. Plays fine. Only wish there were more movies.","5302":"Charming. Forgot how likeable Luke Wilson can be.","5303":"Too choppy","5304":"Not bad, sort of a milder dumb and dumber.","5305":"Different kind. I really liked this movie.","5306":"Primo DeNiro!","5307":"SUPER","5308":"It came just as it was described.","5310":"Classic!","5312":"I'll watch anything with De Niro in it!","5313":"Great movie,the scenario is amazing ,this is a must,recommended ! good quality video and seller","5314":"Its a okay movie. A little weird and off beat. Still entertaining. MarkR","5315":"Never quite got off the ground.  Pun intended.","5316":"Very funny foolishness without the vulgarity of so much of what comes out of Hollywood these days that passes for comedy. Owen and Luke Wilson are great together in this movie.","5317":"Great dvd, arrived quickly, so pleased to have this as part of my collection.  Thanks","5318":"This is a really nice release. For the price I didn't expect more than a plastic case and a disk. Was really surprised. Tri-fold case with photos and stuff, very hip.","5319":"PERFECT THANX!!","5321":"Classic angst, I still feel the same now as a had when it first came out.","5322":"Didn't get it at all. Sucked","5323":"Great collection of Mel Brooks movies! Definitely a must.","5324":"My partner and I LOVE Mel Brooks and this collection had all the movies we love!","5325":"Scorsese's finest film in stunning High Definition","5326":"This is an enjoyable movie and the acting by  Robert De Nero, Jodie Foster and Cybill Shepherd is very good.  But there are no deep lessons here.  It is truly sad that violence is such a deeply ingrained theme in American movies.","5327":"loved it","5329":"I wouldn't know since I turned it off a while back.","5330":"Just didn't capture  my interest at all. Sorry.","5331":"Maybe it was because its nearly 20 years old and my expectations have changed since 1996.  Don't know, I watched about 20 minutes and got bored and turned it off.  I suspect a good review should be by a viewer watching the whole thing but I knew I would never get those minutes back so I cashed in and watched something else.  I don't feel compelled to write any further, read the other one-star reviews they mirror my feelings.","5332":"I'm sorry I watched this movie, a complete waste of time. Actually it was my own fault for not knowing that Luke and Owen Wilson were involved in this sorry piece of cinematic trash. Two-dimensional characters, predictable  plot, sophomoric attempts at humor, and wooden acting combine to make this a movie to avoid.","5333":"It was okay. We were disappointed in the humor and storyline.","5334":"This is the kind of movie that will evoke many different emotions from the watcher. This movie is not for the faint of heart.","5336":"This is one of my favorite De Niro films. Very good acting on his part and very classic movie with twist.","5337":"Some humor but doesn't warrant 4.5 stars. Basically a bunch of dorks without much plot.","5338":"Poor everything","5339":"Good movie to watch to see the start of Owen and Luke Wilson's acting careers. This is an off beat movie about wannabe young criminals.","5340":"Pace is too slow.  Normally I like the actors in this, but I just didn't get it.","5341":"it was OK","5342":"Not worth watching.  Turned it off!!","5343":"Not one of the Owens brothers better efforts, ok to watch if you cant find anything else.","5344":"This is very early Robert DiNiro and he is a skinny young guy in this one.\nQuite disturbing portrait. Jody Foster as a teenage prostitute. This one has to be seen.\nMovie Buffs Listen UP.","5347":"This is Marty at his best. The picture quality is phenomenal, it will transport back to 70's New York with its level of detail, you'll be holding on to purse. This is the best  you'll ever see this movie. Highly recommended.","5348":"This movie is a telling of how boredom and loneliness can drive a person insane. Watch it if you haven't already.","5349":"This is considered one of the classic \"must see\" American films. It essentially began DeNiro and Scorsese's careers. It is a tour de force!","5350":"This movie had some humor but overall was a waste of time.  Kind of pointless","5351":"Sort of classic Owen Wilson but wasn't good enough to finish.","5352":"Another cult classic like \"Say Anything\".","5353":"preety good","5354":"This movie was terrible from beginning to end.","5355":"Not mental stimulation","5356":"this is one freaky ass movie . . . I had a hard time believing that the taxi driver was de Niro until almost the end of the flick . . . this movie ranks right up there with Dog Day Afternoon . . . a depiction of the mind set of Tea Party Republicans, Mitt Romney and John (Boner) Boehner . . . wake up Amurica\n !!","5360":"It is for younger 20-30 age group. Not our taste in movies.","5361":"wow a \"new release\" on amazon that's almost 20 years old.  Canceling my prime membership.","5362":"Not too good.","5363":"One Wilson is entertaining, two is insanity.  This is and enjoyable piece of escapism!","5364":"This freakin movie is one of the best movies out there period! I can't get enough of this kick ass movie! Everybody should go out and buy it!","5366":"This performance is one of the greatest performances ever filmed. DeNIRO is just perfect here. Just perfect. And Scorese scores again! That man has one incredible vision. I hope he lives forever! These two make a great team! Fantastic film!","5367":"Taxi Driver is the definitive cinematic portrait of loneliness and alienation manifested as violence. It is as if director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader had tapped into precisely the same source of psychological inspiration","5369":"I chose this rate because is a wonderfull edition of this wonderfull movie , and have portuguese subtitles. Recomend this product","5371":"This movie was a great one. A true De niro Classic. It just gives insight to how this one man who really doesn't have a lot of education or social skills sees the world and at the end of the day it leaves you guessing who the real hero is in society sometimes.","5372":"Aside from foul language at times, it was great acting and story. New 4k was worth it. Not sure why Sony picked some of the new (old) 4K selections. Hope more 4k blueray's are coming.","5373":"This my all time favorite Robert Di Nero that he was ever made! I was expecting it to be one of favorite movies of all time! Excellent, excellent movie for the ages of 18 and over!","5374":"exlnt a highly recommended a must have for any movie collector, one you'll watch more than once and then some...","5375":"This is just not an 'ordinary' movie.  For that alone it has some merit, but if you have a desire to see different perspectives on things, this is worth a watch.  It is excellently made.","5376":"STUPID !","5377":"Total disappointment and really sucked.  I expected better from Owen Wilson.","5379":"this movie sucks. i thought this was going to be compelling but it wasn't at all. it was quite dull and unwatchable. i turned it off five minutes into the flim","5380":"This is a great movie.\nAwesome DVD.\nIf you have not seen this movie, you should buy this DVD version.\nI highly recommend it.","5381":"I believe this was De Niro's first starring movie.\nAlso a glimpse of the master, Martin Scorsese.\nA bit on the bloody side but way before its time.\nI believe it was made in 1972?","5382":"This movie is quite interesting. It grabs you through the oddity of its plot. But once you're in it will leave you in suspense til the end.","5383":"I've always loved the opening of this amazing movie, the cinematography and music really set the tone in an almost modern film noir type of mood that is sustained throughout the film. De Niro is great as is the rest of the cast, but the highlight and focus is naturally on De Niro and watching his character ebb and flow into social and mental instability is compelling.","5384":"Tiresome, relentlessly unfunny comedy, aboiut stupid people doing stupid things.","5385":"really dumb...don't waste your time or be fooled by positive reviews!","5386":"I never heard of this movie before until I selected it, and it's a pretty good one.  Good acting, awkward story.  It won't win an Oscar but it's an amusing watch.","5387":"Fantastic blu ray transfer and product packaging for a very reasonable price.\n\nMovies like this don't get made anymore, which is sad.\n\nFor some reason this film triggers some sort of menu glitch in my Sony blu ray player, but I've confirmed that the problem lies with the player itself and not the disc.","5388":"This is one of the Best movies I have seen yet?... Great Story Great Character Development something that everyone should have in their Collections. Nothing Wrong with it!","5389":"While DeNiro might be ruining his legacy with movies that do not deserve even the mention of his name  (\"Silver Linings Playbook\" is an exception and maybe a sign of good to come). We have movies like this to remind us why he terrified us and why we thought and knew he was a masterful talent","5391":"What a complete waste of film,This ranks right up there with Man on the moon  (Jim C) love the actor hate the movie ,\n2015 Hopefully we will see better movies this year ,a few good ones for 2014 . But what ever happen to the movies ?\nIts been years since i have saw a really good movie , well i recently watched a movie Miss Potter ,loved it .","5392":"Great cast, interesting story","5393":"Good Early Luke Wilson film.\n\nIt's a bit funny seeing the way he used to act as compared to now.","5394":"Whatever","5396":"Martin S. does areat job directing this film. DeNero shines as a young actor. Jodi Foster was oh so young in this movie and did a great job.","5397":"this is a great movie one that is similar is \"Falling Down\". I won't be selling it, classic De Niro","5399":"Good but not great. No Mel Brooks collection is complete without his masterpiece The Producers.","5400":"Where is The Producers? That is a gigantic hole in this collection.  Otherwise, this was quite a bargain at $27 for the blu-ray box.","5401":"I wish Wes could go back in time and re-do this one.","5402":"Stupid movie.","5403":"This was a pretty so-so movie and boring.  These guys make better movies.  They need better stories or screen writers.","5404":"Thought it was going to be a charming funny go round with the \"boys\"... bored the heck out of me. Had to fast forward a couple times. Poor editing maybe. Silly comes to mind. Simple minded..another... and I like all of the actors. Something not happening for me.","5405":"I liked bottle rocket but I think I prefer the later Wes Anderson movies. It was interesting to see the Wilson brothers in there Dave you and Wes Anderson in his debut.","5406":"My schwarts is biggest","5408":"Mel Brooks is a great director and funnyman. His films, while often filled with potty humor are genuinely funny and fun to watch.","5409":"Mel's best.  Buy it.","5410":"Perfect in every way! Thank you! :)","5411":"Excellent selection of his movies. Got the family into watching them with me, a good laugh for all. A good addition to my collection.","5413":"This is one the best BD packs there is, the material is perfect, the cards, the way it opens the disc art, everything, its totally worth it. And the movie what to say ? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ?","5414":"Taxi Driver is a classic film, and in this presentacion comes not only with the movie in blu ray (that have an incredible image and sound) it also came in a perfect packaging and with lots of very good extras.","5417":"A monumental film about human nature, about the aftermath of the Vietnam war, about New York in the seventies. These are the several layers of reading this film lends itself to and they are all worth the viewer's time. For this reason this is a film that must be seen several times to get all it has to offer. It can not be metabolized in one viewing. One of the best films of the  seventies.\n\nThe BD version is very good, and quite a few extras complete an excellent deal.","5418":"Rejected by better-educated and higher-socially-placed girl, a very ordinary New York taxi driver - ex-marine turns his range and vibrant energy at relatively vulnerable objects shop-lifters and amateur pimps are.\n\nNice epitomizing of pre-Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani New York.","5419":"W.A. straight out of the gate, and what a start!  Begin here, then, if captivated, proceed to savor the rest of this magnificent, highly idiosyncratic filmmakers work.  It's a world quite unto itself.","5420":"I think Luke Wilson wrote this so he could stand in front of the camera and talk. Amazing how many people love to do that (YouTube).","5421":"I gave up after a few minutes.  I have no clue what this was supposed to be about but it was obviously crap.  Couldn't take more than about 10 minutes.","5422":"I could go on for days but won't.  Suffice to say:  Absolutely love it, as always.  Wes Anderson is my God.","5424":"I really have enjoyed the movies and am glad to have obtained it for my collection. You must own it also","5425":"The films are great, but I thought the book would be comparable to the awesome book included in the Planet of the Apes  Collection.  Not the case, not a lot to the book, I would recommend getting the films only collection if the price is less.","5426":"The Mel Brooks Collection is a great set. it contains almost ALL of his directed movies. The Twelve Chairs, Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, Silent Movie, High Anxiety, History of the World: Part 1, To Be or Not To Be, SpaceBalls, and Robin Hood: Men in Tights. This set does not contain The Producers (1968) or Dracula Dead and Loving it (1995) though nither of those are available on seperate blu-ray anyway.","5427":"I mean really, do I have to even say anything?  It's Mel Brooks folks, and this is his movie collection.  I went through them all in a weekend, laughing it up the entire time, this is gold!","5429":"I'm not a fan of \"Men In Tights\", but even it looks great in this set. Beautiful set at a good price, and I loved the \"book\" that comes with it.","5430":"All my favorite Mel Brooks movies, in one place and on blu-ray!  This is a great product for Mel Brooks fans.  The box is a reasonable size (unlike some other collections), so it fits in my cabinet, and it's easy to watch any of the movies.","5431":"Mel Brooks is a master comedian.  When I saw this being offered in Today's Deal I HAD TO GET IT!","5432":"Even without \"The Producers\" the Mel Brooks Collection is a major gem in my dvd library.  A \"must have\" for a true Mel fan. vince on oahu, hi","5434":"was fun to see the man get his hand blown clean off, not a movie for young children but for us adults its a very fun timeless classic","5438":"Brand new DVD, good price and arrived fast.  This is a classic movie that should be in every movie buffs collection.","5442":"This movie focused on romantacizing breaking the law.  However, best laid plans go awry as the gullible burglars are duped.","5443":"Wes Anderson's comedy is without a doubt a hilarious flick that could be called by many as a Reservoir Dogs for the Anderson fans. A highly suggested film.","5447":"Mel Brooks has a controversial kind of humour, either you like it or you hate it.\nThis compilation contains Mel Brooks` interpretation of famous movie milestones of the last century, most of them having become milestones themselves.\nFrom the master of reinterpretation and anachronisms. The more movie classics you have seen, the more you will laugh watching these delightfully funny parodies and parabels.","5448":"At first I wasn't going to this at first I earned too little and it cost too much; you could imagine my surprise when the price was cut in half and I never regretted the purchase.","5452":"A rambling, oddball shaggy dog story, but it packs some real emotion and laughs along the way.  Terrific understated performances, and good use of images and music.\n\nI recently watched it a 2nd time and thought I wasn't all that into it... until near the end, when it suddenly got me on a deeper level emotionally than on first viewing.  There's something in it about the loss of childhood dreams that resonates beyond the silly and playful surface.","5453":"I thought it would be 2 1\/2 star movie but it's a 4 star movie.  Love it when that happens!","5458":"The movie is one of the best movies, by one of the best directors of all time. Most people know that, But. The packaging of this dvd, is the best i think ive ever seen for a movie. The case is perfect, and as someone who likes to collect movies, that actually really matters to me. The special features are great as well, with 3 commentaries , a documentary, and more. Perfect, a must own.","5459":"I rent yesterday here in Brasil  the Blu-ray \"Taxi Driver\". A lot of shots has a good PQ but  there is a LOT of shots that the PQ is BAD !!! In Highdef Digest the reviwer  gave  5 stars for PQ ... I can't understand ! I have a Infocus 1080p and old movies in BD like  \"2001\", \"The Shining\" and others looks GREAT !!!\n\"Taxi Driver\" is a deception ... Sometimes looks like a so so DVD !!!","5462":"3 stupid guys do stupid things; it's supposed to be funny or clever or quirky or something entertaining; also throw in a little romance.  If you like Owen Wilson movies, you'll probably like this one.  Otherwise, don't bother. The 4.5 star rating from the other reviewers is way too high in my opinion.  It's a very average movie.","5464":"A little rough around the edges - not as refined or clever as some recent Anderson movies, but definitely a Anderson film. I recommend it for any fans...","5468":"i purchased the mel brooks collection on amazon .com at fantastic price.delivery was very prompt.the titles were all beautifully presented.you can't go wrong with amazon.com no matter the product.","5472":"Any film by Paul schrader is ok with me.  I love his work.  This film gives me chills even to think about it. I have the soundstrack and can see the film in my head as i listen to it.  I also bought the book. \"The making of Taxi Driver.\"  It is  amazing.  I saw this film in the theaters  when i was 16 in high school.  I am not sure if back then i totally understood it.  It took a few viewings as I got older.","5476":"What would be a classic without it's presentation?! This digipack special edition brigs a few cards within with pictures of the stars and movie scenes. The art is incredible! So as the picture and the soud DTS-HD-MA.","5488":"Robert De Niro and more star in Martin Scorsese's 1976 drama.\nA Vietman Vet takes a job as a New York cabbie and turns\nhomicidal. This is a terrific film that's definitely one of De\nNiro and Scorsese's best. This 2-disc set has good picture\nand sound plus neat extras. Get this.","5491":"I didn't think the music soundtrack has held up as well as the rest of the film. It's Gothic in sound, almost like a B-movie from the 50s. But that's what Scorcese grew up on, so maybe he meant it to be that way. DeNiro is classic here, as is Jodi Foster at age 12. I had forgotten about the Cybil Sheppard side plot. Harvey Keitel is a howl as the coke addict pimp. Nice hair. The film looks great in its current incarnation. It's a piece of art. See it.","5493":"I was captured by the genius of Rushmore.  Was delighted by Tannenbaums.  Before Zissou, I was desperate for a little more Wes.  For Wes fans, the film is plenty good (certainly better than the life aquatic) although doesnt rise to the level of Rushmore or Tannenbaums.  All the trademarks are there, just a little rougher in timing and delivery.","5500":"Amazon has never let me down.  I received this dvd in perfect condition and in a timely manner.  Thanks.","5501":"If you like the style of Wes Anderson, you'll in all probability like this film. I saw his other films first (\"Rushmore\", \"The Royal Tennenbaums\" & \"The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou\") and thought that maybe this, his first movie (right?), might not be of the same standard ... but I think it is.","5505":"Bottle Rocket isn't a bad movie, but it's not a particularly good one either.  The biting satire present in Anderson's later films, Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums, isn't quite there in this one making the absurdities of the characters in Bottle Rocket less appealing.  The basic moral premis in this film is the same as all Anderson's other movies--Failure and Redemption, but it's not executed as well, and it's not nearly as funny.","5509":"Wes Andersons fun film before his first big hit \"Rushmore\" this one includes the WIlson brothers who are great actors together, this film has an odd plot but it's fun to watch it sort of drags in some parts but its deffinatly worth one watch or more.","5519":"This film is incredible. DeNiro gives an outstanding performance and the supporting actors do very well. The cinematography is great, and it really enhances the feel of the movie. Worth watching by anyone who wants to see a well-thought, well-planned, phenomenal movie.","5521":"what a great film. i read a book on violence in movies and this was definitely in it, and you can see why. don't think of this as an action movie, this is what most dads would call \"Artsy\" but i like artsy. i don't want to spoil the movie but robert de niro kills a lot of people at the end and it is TIGHT.","5522":"Quiet, competent\nfirst flick by the Wilson boys,\nslightly slow but fresh.","5527":"not as bad as royal tennanbaums but not as good as rushmore. i like wes anderson as a director but he needs to do real comedy not dark comedy.","5541":"This is one of those 70's flicks that meant to shock the audience, and it did...back then. \"Taxi Driver\" is slowly-paced, pondering at times, and very self-indulgent, in particular one scene in with Martin Scorsese stating how he's going to kill his cheating wife.\nThere are more than dozen films better from this era, with better story lines, better acting and something more important to say.","5542":"You've got to have been in a coma for the past 30 years not to have seen this movie. Robert De Niro as Travis Bickle, the \"troubled\" cab driver is awesome and scary. Jodie Foster (Iris) is alarmingly sexy, Cybill Shepherd (Betsy) is dreamy, and Harvey Keitel (Sport) is the evil pimp. The big shoot-out towards the end of the film is an unforgettable \"classic.\" Tension-building direction from Martin Scorsese. Robert De Niro - The Best.","5543":"Bad acting, lame story and very poor execution. It could have been good if carried out right but it moves too slowly. The dialogue doesn't make much sense and it's like Martin was just killing film time by having the actors talk slowly so they had less to write. Nothing brilliant about this film, 1\/5","5545":"My favourite character in this movie is the punjabi old guy who also played Gene Hackman's servant in the Royal Tenenbaums, he's funny stuff! This movie has it's good laughs but it has some weird moments and I don't really know how to define it well. It seemed some parts were waaaaaaaaaay too dragged on while other parts(such as the ROBBERY itself) could have been viewed by the audience alot longer. You should see this one atleast once!","5548":"The first time I watched it, I fell asleep through the middle. The dry nature of the dialogue and uninspiring cinematography didn't catch my attention for a mid-afternoon viewing (right around nap time). However, upon further viewings, I fell in love with the true brilliance of the subtle humor. I still don't like Rushmore, but really loved The Royal Tennenbaums, and in watching this movie, it's like watching the genesis of some great writers, a director, and actors.","5551":"It was easy to see that Robert Deniro was going to be an amazing actor from this film.  I caught most of his movies from the 80's and 90's so he was a seasoned actor by then.  In Taxi Driver you could see the rawness and hunger in him.  Loved it.","5553":"There's no question in my mind that the most significant influence in the direction is Roman Polanski.","5555":"One of those rare films that shines like a gem.  Little known diddy launched huge careers for several talents involved.  Great story filled with wonderful performances and a light, feel good vibe.  Non-traditional filmaking with a bright perspective by Director Wes Anderson.  Anderson co-penned this film (and others that followed) with Owen Wilson whose character Dignon steals the show.  A great movie that can put you in a great mood.","5566":"There is no other way to describe this DVD than just saying flawless. I mean the features are fantasic, the transfer is next to perfect, and let's just say the package is absolutely different, original, and is a must for any collector. I'm glad I waited this long to finally buy this movie.","5579":"Scorsese's dark vision of human alienation in an urban wasteland captures the seaminess of pre-Giuliani Manhattan, and DeNiro's career-making performance as Bickle is haunting, recalling those real-life outcasts who have used violent crime to tell an oblivious world: \"I was here!\". Stunningly directed and acted, this picture is every bit as disturbing now as when released. Brilliant, but not for the faint of heart.","5585":"A \"must have\" classic! Keeps you watching on the edge of your chair and wanting for more. I highly recommend.","5589":"My friend recommended this movie to me and said it was the funniest movie ever.  Boy was she wrong!  This movie has no plot and is in no way funny.  The only feelings I had for this movie after I was finished watching it was sympathy for actors because it might ruin their careers.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  You can, if you really hate that person.","5591":"WOW. Thats all I have to say about the film AND the DVD. If you are looking for the best of the best in films, check out this controversial movie. The extras include ALL:\n\n*Making of Documentary\n\n*Photo Montage\n\n*Portrait Gallery\n\n*Storyboard Sequence\n\n*Original Screenplay\n\n*Advertising Materials\n\n*Theatrical Trailers","5604":"this is one of the best films of all time.\n\ngreat cast, great directing, the story is very real like,\n\nand its very chilling","5624":"This is a great movie.  With top notch acting, a great story, and some nasty gun battles.  Just buy it you will not be dissapointed.","5627":"Short and Sweet, DeNiro, Scorsese, Foster, Kietel, Sheppard and others are brought together to mak the best character study ever, it is slow but intriguing and superbly directed, it captures the characteristics of madness and sleaze and you can relate to Travis Bickle (DeNiro) in every way, even though he is a raging lunatic who his quite contempt to blowing a few pimp's heads off. It is superbly performed and pulled of and that is why it deserves its five stars and recognition.","5628":"Scorsese grew up amidst violence and bloodshed.  That he is able to reproduce murder and mayhem so realistically is an achievement that deserves one star.  The rest of the film, with its hookers, pimps, and contrived direction is really not worth mentioning.  A perfect example of intense violence mistaken for great artistic expression.  \"Taxi Driver\" is, quite simply, not nearly as good as \"enlightened\" cinephiles make it out to be.","5633":"Great film but I don't understand how Bickle walks free after murdering 3 people?","5641":"You already know that this is a classic film.  What makes the DVD worth owning is the fascinating making-of documentary that accompanies it.\nSchraeder, Scorcese, De Niro, Foster, Brooks, and Keitel all share their memories of the film's inception, production, and reception upon release.  Their insights and recollections are actually worth hearing, and the documentary as a whole makes you wonder why most other DVDs have such useless extras.","5644":"If I could I will not giving any star, it's an horrible movie.  Robert Deniro is terrible in it, he gets on my nerves, Cybil Shepard is annoying, only Jodie Foster seem fresh and interesting but we don't saw her much.  To much violence for nothing and awful cheezy music.  It was soooo boring.","5645":"'Taxi Driver' is a classic.  Although it may seem dated, it is still a facinating study of lonliness and the paranoia, sadness, and frustration it can bring.  De Niro brings one of his best performances as a former vet slowly going psychotic.  A must see, but not for the faint of heart.","5647":"De Niro has always been the man by my book. He is such a great actor. This is a must see for any De Niro fan. At a very young age you can see how his tallets make the taxi driver seem so alive. He gives him a purpose in life to do something good. The dvd is also filled with many extras interviews with De Niro, Jody Foster etc.. Everyone knows the line, \"You talking to me\" come on what a classic. If you own Scareface this better be right next to it.","5658":"One of the greatest films of all time and with its fair share of a few good laughs. The funniest scene had to be DeNiro taking Cybil Shepherd on a date...to a porno theatre! Her reactions are just classic. \"You've got to be kidding, this is a dirty movie.\" And it's not just any dirty movie, it's a Masters & Johnson instructional documentary! We also get Jodie Foster as a teenage hooker and Harvey Keitel as her crazy pimp. Sometimes it is just so much I can barely handle it.","5663":"I can go back to all the performances Robert DeNiro has made over the years, but I can honestly say that this was the best movie he ever worked in.  Yes, DeNiro as Jake Lamotta in \"Raging Bull\" was his shinning path to greatness, his portrayal of Travis Bickle was one that still leaves me with such chills.  Taxi Driver was one of Martin Scorsese's best movies.","5664":"I have heard this film as one of those films alot of people watch over and over or to just watch in awe the acting and directing that takes place on film. A good movie for any dvd collector!","5665":"This movie is truely one of the greatest films of all time. Taxi Driver is surely De Niros greatest. Martin Scorsese is an absolute genious. I reccomend tis movie to everyone.","5669":"I will just come out and say it...Do not watch this movie if you can't be open minded and look into the lives of people who have it so bad that you wonder, \"How do they stay together?!\"\nThis is why I LOVE this movie. It is superbly acted, written and presented as a \"Hard look at life.\"\nIt is a difficult movie to watch but you will see that even though drugs and violence can destroy a family, some families survive.","5671":"A brutal, harrowing film about domestic violence filled with the most swearing probably ever committed to film. Worth seeing for the amazing performances of the two leads, most notably the abusive husband played to perfection by Ray Winstone. Directed by Gary Oldman and loosely based on his own experiences growing up this is one childhood noone would want repeated.","5676":"Martin Scorscese introduces us with an epic tale about a New Yorker taxi cab driver. A brilliant work of art, to say the least. From the beggining of the movie to the very end, your eyes are glued to the television screen. One of the best movies done by Martin Scorscese. This is Hollywood at it's best.","5684":"One of the best films ever made. DeNiro has never shined this much before. M.S.'s finest film.\nThis DVD is a must with great extras for all the fans.","5689":"Martin Scorsese's (Robert deNiro) grimy look at life on the raw side as seen through the eyes of the dysfunctional taxi driver. A masterpeace. Sharply written the film is credible to the end.","5691":"A great movie if you wanna see what insomnia and loneliness can make a person do!\nThis movie is truly a great addition to your collection.\nRobert de Niro gives an outstanding performance. My favourite scene in this movie is when he is talking to his reflection in the mirror. Awesome stuff!","5694":"I've seen this film many times over the years and I'm always stunned by the final shoot-out. Very Dark.\nA truely brilliant comentary on the under-belly of society through the eyes of the under-belly of society.\nOne of my All Time Favorite Films!","5697":"This is one of the basic films of the last quarter of the 20th century and this DVD offers a good chance to own it in a version remastered both in audio and video under the control of Scorsese in person!!\nAudio and video tracks are both pleasing. The images are faithful to the movie experience, while the DS audio track is more effective and involving than many DD tracks we're used listenin' to.","5700":"Among the top 20 greatest infact. and a heck of a really good dvd!..","5704":"Martin Scorsese's colorful masterpiece is one of the best films of the 70'es and one of Robert De Niro best films. This film may turn off some do to the violence. But for people who like strong stomic drama's this is a film for you. The DVD is very good and the picture and sound are perfect.","5711":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  Great movie, even better DVD. Great features.  The best documentry I have ever seen.","5715":"The \"support\" behind this DVD is equal to the film. Interviews interlace with the terror of knowing that this film presages the reality that was to come, literally, with the suspense that was Hitchkock was all about. Photography=BRILLIANT A special citiation to Mr Special effect for creating what was a that time considered violent.","5720":"Cause he can't read lips,\nHard of hearing Travis asks:\n\"You talking to me?\"","5723":"Isolation, insanity, social issues, nsecurity, Scorsese's intensive storytelling and amazing camerashots, the best actor in the world in a starring role, young Jodie Foster... what more can you hope! This is the  ultimate social movie, a milestone in Scorsese's career and a breathtaking  roleplay by DeNiro as an isolated vet. Stunned, that's what I am!","5737":"The New York city shots are very arty and interesting to look at. The cinematography is very 70's which is a good thing as it captures the style of filmmaking of the time. I think Scorsese makes Bickel out to be the good  guy to show how sometimes even the baddie can be turned into a goodie, hell  just look at WWF! Anyway, thats enough waffle from me!","5738":"Remarkable,powerful,poignant film about Man's decent into madness as seen through the eyes of a vengeful N.Y.C. taxi driver\/Vietnam vet who tries to protect a 15 year old prostitute from an evil Harvey Keitel. Great  writing,directing and acting highlight this disturbing film.","5740":"This film is the ultimate potrait of one man driven by society to extreme and homicidal means. He builds up anger and builds up anger until he wants to do something about it, but what?Then he meets Jodie Foster and through  her he uses his anger to help her. The direction on this film is amazing. A  must for any Scorsese, DeNiro or Foster fan.","5741":"good","5742":"Excellent Thank you ! Excellent service rapide merci beaucoup !","5743":"After all these years still my all-time favorite.\nI've gotten to meet the cast twice.\nboth times i have to say a highlight of my life.","5744":"Horror classic. Nough said.","5745":"This bluray is awesome great picture and audio quality and lots of extras can't recommended this bluray enough","5747":"Just recieved this. Case is cheaply made but thats not my concern. The bluray transfer looks fantastic on my 4k tv. It plays perfectly on my PS4 if anyone had questions about that. Very happy","5749":"Great movie.  Definitely better than the remake.","5750":"Classic 80's vampire film","5751":"Classic","5752":"Sooo hoky and cheesy its almost criminal but who am i to arrest anybody..worth it for that alone to be seen since it has everything in it except elvira  lol","5753":"Definitely one of my favorite vampire movies. I love this movie. For me. This movie is timeless. .It never gets old","5754":"The best orginal vampire movie ever","5755":"I love this movie. It's horror\/comedy at it's finest.","5756":"Its a great movie. I recommend","5757":"Just bought this and probably hadn't seen it in 25 years. Rated R for a reason- lots of cursing, blood splattering and sexually suggestive scenes (beware if children watching. You should fast forward).  Great 80s horror without all the typical slashing seen in the Nightmare on Elm Street or Halloween movies.","5758":"Great vampires movie from the 80's. The video and audio quality from this Blu-ray edition are great. The extras (a ton of them) superb. Good value for your money. A must for a Fright Night fan.","5759":"Well worth the price. The documentary alone is well worth the price. Just don't see a better quality edition coming out. Fans of this cult classic will want this in their collection.","5760":"When I first watched this film on Blu-Ray, the picture and quality was so clear. It has been quite a few years since I've seen this film. And now that I have it on Blu-Ray, I feel very happy!!!","5762":"PART OF MY COLLECTION. GREAT MOVIE","5763":"OK","5764":"Product as described. Smooth transaction.","5765":"Quick shipping and I have loved this movie since 1985","5766":"Excellent","5767":"classic movie","5768":"Great.","5769":"Great show","5770":"Still crazy after all these years!","5771":"excellent movie","5772":"Thank you will shop again.","5773":"Best vampire movie EVER!!","5774":"I think this is one of the best vampire movies,it can hold its own with any other out there,and better than some,I have another copy,so I didn't have to open this one","5775":"Maybe this was great in the 80's, but now it's just cliche. Not even charmingly so. For when this was made, there are some good special effects work, not by todays standards, but back then, impressive.","5776":"Works fine on USA Non-modded PS3.","5777":"forgot how I enjoyed this movie, until watching again,maybe top of list for one of best vampire movies made","5778":"great film and deal","5779":"BLOWS AWAY THE TWI-LIGHT TIME VERSION\n\nAND IT IS A REAL blu ray\n\nand you don't pay a $100.00","5780":"I am happy with my purchase. it arrived quickly and was as described..","5781":"Classic, funny, well-done scary movie.  Super sexy vampire!  Great acting without the need for over rated special effects and gore.  Really fun movie to watch alone or with friends.","5782":"One of the best old school horror movies ever. Forget the remake and watch the original and Fright Night 2. The first one is the best.","5783":"Very clear picture and sound.","5785":"A very funny yet gruesome horror film. The vampire mythology was a bit skewed from normal rules, however that did not take away from the scares in this film. Must see, especially for those who also loved An American Werewolf in London.","5787":"Good deal!","5788":"Good","5789":"Matthew Lillard is somewhat believable in this film, aside from his obviously fake Mohawk, SLC punk is worth a watch. However, unless you were around when it came out, you may miss the hype.","5790":"I love this movie, even though it's about the type of privileged fellows I grew up around who had the luxury to be like what he was. What I like is that he's honest about that.","5792":"This movie is one of the best Vampire movies ever this one and the sequel really got Me grabbed\/interested in the Vampire Movies!","5793":"great!","5794":"this is a awesome movie. this is a great vampire film a horror classic. loved this movie. the acting is great, the special effects are great and the story is great. love these old horror movies they are better than the ones out now. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. hope the remake is good.","5795":"this is a awesome movie. this is a great vampire film a horror classic. loved this movie. the acting is great, the special effects are great and the story is great. love these old horror movies they are better than the ones out now. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do. hope the remake is good.","5796":"Fright Night is a pretty good vampire film. Kind of silly, kind of good. Roddy McDowell is in it. Love the Disco Music. Chris Sarandon is the vampire in this one, and makes a scary one right down to his fingernails.","5797":"Love this DVD. No complaints!","5798":"A great oldie but a goodie; enough to give the grandkids a fright without all the graphic gore and violence.","5799":"One of my favorites!","5801":"It should be noted that this movie is dated in several ways & its a more or less light horror\\comedy. its made to be a fun popcorn throwback with good acting & a decent plot. Recalled it being ok as a kid but as an adult , the more I watch it the better it gets. If only modern films put in half this much effort!!! \"AMYYYYYY\"","5803":"Great Movie and very good acting","5804":"this is the original classic vampire film to me . i love the plot and the acting is great. i love the scenes and how the vampires are more like what you think they are suppose to be . there are a few corny points in the film however it is a classic and some parts are slightly scary . for there being a lack of blood and guts for a horror film you will want to rewatch this often.","5805":"This is a classic vamp film that I have always wanted. It is a true classic","5806":"It had been a long time since I had seen the original Fright Night and watched it again recently. I couldn't remember anything other than I thought it was alright back then. The first 2\/3 of the movie was a bit boring but then it picked up markedly over the last 1\/3 with some great 80's gore just oozing charm and turns into a pretty fun campy horror that still holds up well today.","5807":"I LOVE this movie, it's good for a laugh and some occasional tears... One of my favorite movies starring Matthew Lillard.","5808":"Classic","5809":"loved it.","5810":"An instant punk classic! Buy this movie.","5811":"Awesome Classic ! No CG!!!  Get the popcorn out turn down the lights :)","5812":"Love the movie, I noticed the price finally coming down a bit so grabbed a copy of the Blu-ray\/German region free. I've had the DVD since that came out, but it's nice to have in HD. This movie is a classic, perfect for Halloween etc, some creepy vampire elements but also a good sense of humor is incorporated. It's a movie that is filmed well, cast well, has a enjoyable soundtrack relative to the 80's and never takes itself to seriously as a horror genre film.","5813":"great!","5814":"love it","5815":"Great movie!! Classic. Considering this Blu Ray movie costs a fraction of what others charge, worth the $30 investment. It plays flawlessly on my Sony Blu Ray 4K Player. No problems. Picture transfer quality is excellent. I only wish the price was a little less expensive, but otherwise if you are a fan of this Horror classic, by all means indulge and enjoy","5816":"A true classic. This one is way better than any remake and its better than part 2. Love it!","5817":"Great dance Sean","5818":"Very enjoyable , and somewhat frightening. with some comic relief added.","5819":"For any true horror fan you cant get much better then fright night.","5820":"AWSOME came as advertised and didn't take long to get here","5821":"Great buy","5822":"have always loved this movie","5824":"Another great classical movie, a must add to the 80's collection. Love it.","5825":"Love it","5826":"Excellent.","5827":"good","5828":":)","5829":"This is the original Fright Night movie, which I really enjoyed when it came out.  I have been wanting to add it to my DVD collection, so I was able to find it for a very good price.","5830":"One of those movies that nobody knows, and after they watch, people try to get their friends to watch it.\n\nThis movie was in a Blockbuster $5 bin and it became such a 'cult' movie within my group of friends.  It was great seeing that other people had also the same feelings for this movie.\n\nDefinitely a roller coaster of a ride.","5831":"In a year of good movies (1999 was just fantastic for some reason), SLC Punk was easily missed by many. It has its share of problems, of course, and Matthew Lillard as an actor is extremely divisive. However, if you can approach it without hating it simply because of him, SLC Punk is an enjoyable coming of age film with a pretty great soundtrack. Also, look for an early performance by Jason Segel.","5832":"AWESOME CLASSIC, this was an amazing movie!!!!!","5833":"One of the best movies of all time!","5835":"Great","5836":"Deep 1980s I wish I lived in that decade! I was only born in 1991. The Alvin and the Chipmunks episode Babysitter Fright Night was a spoof off this movie! I guess it makes sense since this movie Roch and Rolls out its 1980s!","5837":"This is one of my favorite movies and I was thrilled to be able to add it to my movie collection in a higher quality format. I really think that this is one of those fun movies that can reach almost anyone. Comedy? Check! Vampires? Check! Catchy '80s soundtrack? Check! Blood and guts? Check! Romance? Check! Bromance? Check! Action? Check! Do you need to add this to your cart now? Check!","5838":"I only use the star system when rating movies and books.","5839":"Always liked this original version of the movie, a bit campy in places but quite enjoyable.  Chris Sarandon is great as the vampire.","5840":"One of my favorite movies.  Cult classic!","5842":"whats not to love about this movie","5843":"I just got the movie in the mail this morning, I've been looking for it on DVD everywhere. It's one of my favorite movies, especially the dance scene, I always gotta get up and dance. Chris Sarandon and William Ragsdale did very good playing their characters. With Halloween coming up, I'll be watching it. I  this movie.","5845":"This is both funny and scary if you are young. I seen it years ago and had to get it for my DVD collection.","5847":"I love this movie!\nSolid story.","5848":"Always enjoyed this film.","5849":"slc punk is truly a independent cult classic about two punks going to college in salt lake city with moments of humor along with drama and action id recommend this movie to anyone in highschool\/college","5850":"Good movie.","5852":"Now I'm sure it is a Fright Night 3 even my sister said it the 80's Classic did all of them get turn into DVD's.","5853":"An excellent vampire movie with excellent acting and an excellent plot.  Have watched it several times and will again, it's that good.","5854":"A classic!  A great movie to watch on Halloween night!  It has that small town setting, mixed with the 80s wonderfulness... it's fantastic!","5855":"One of my absolute favorite horror movies from my youth, as well as an awesome soundtrack.","5856":"Yea I am a punk, Good to see this flick again.","5857":"This is a fun movie. Love it","5858":"I loved this movie!!! It's got mystery and horror ...and comedy too!!!","5859":"Awesome product love it.","5860":"I loved this when it came out. It's still fun today","5861":"Cheap DVD for an old 80's flick. Too bad the blu-ray is insanely overpriced beyond compare.","5862":"Awesome","5863":"Awesome!","5864":"Great item","5865":"Better then the remake.","5866":"No special features , but if you buy this or the other region free import ; you can tell all of those sellers trying to screw everyone with their outlandish price tags :  \" Bite Me \"","5867":"very good movie great horror movie thank you","5868":"Great movie if you l like classic 80s movies...","5869":"Classic u know i couldn't even watch this as a kid?  Great effects makes me miss the originals instead of all this cgi....","5870":"OK, can anyone tell my why the blue ray is $200??\n\nI would review the film, but instead I will tell you to go buy it. Now. It's one of the best vampire films, period. You will love it.\n\nSo, why is the Blue Ray $200??","5871":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES.","5872":"Why so much? That is ridiculous. I love the  movie but not nearly $200.0 worth.","5873":"This is another family fun movie for all to enjoy anytime of the year not just Halloween.","5874":"love these old movies.","5875":"I really like it, but I still look forward to part 2 come out with an affordable price.","5876":"Not far from the truth. Sombody's true life story? (maybe) That's pretty much how the years went in the scene.","5877":"Awesome scenery. I like the social styles of the groups mingling. I've seen it many times.","5878":"I always Cry when Heroine Bob dies! I love this movie! Has a great and attractive cast! I wish they would make A second movie","5879":"Campy classic, now almost thirty years old.  I loved it then and I still love it now.  Real makeup and special effects long before CGI.  Great story, if predictable.  Roddy McDowell is at his best.  Chris Sarandon plays the evil-undead to a tee.  Far, far superior to the recent remake (which was a hatchet job without thought).  The only negative is that my youngest daughter thought it was amusing...and not scary or thought-provoking!","5881":"Fright Night Movie Review\n\nLoved this movie! It played perfectly and I enjoyed watching it very much! Such a Classic! I will definitely buy more movies from this seller.\n\nThanks!\n\nCate","5882":"Great Movie!","5883":"Excellent movie Excellent blu Ray ...Available to buy in Australia $15 or Germany for 14 euros .","5884":"Great movie. Some movies shouldn't be remade, The new one is good but this one is classic.","5885":"I remember when I was a younger I loved this movie...","5887":"this is such a great movie!  entert aining, fun, funny, and just simply a classic.  you won't be let down!","5889":"This movie does not let up on action and keeps it going all the way to the end. The movie had me in suspense because I honestly couldn't tell what would happen. The things that movies usually wait until the end to show, Fright Night showed in the first 20 minutes. The only thing that I didn't care for was the drawn out love scene between the vampire and the girl. Other than that, I enjoyed it.","5890":"The original and best. Saw this in the theaters when it came out and am still really amazed at the makeup and the transformation scenes. Really scary teeth on these vampires -sharklike and huge. The remake had nothing on this one.\n\nDefinitely worth a look if you like vampire\/horror, with some cheeky humor in between. Also has Roddy MacDowall in it, which never hurt a movie.","5891":"saw this on TV when it first came out, had it on VHS, but had to get it on DVD","5892":"No way to add to the reviews- this is hands down from plot, actors, music score, everything one of the iconic 80's classics and one of the best vampire movies of all time, so I will add this- notice in Peter Vincents apartment, how careful they are that you never see his reflection in any of the mirrors, even though by some angles you should; pretty sure that was intentional.","5893":"Fright Night... this is the \"original\" and the best! Suspenseful at times. Funny at times. Roddy McDowell is perfect in this movie. If you believe in vampires, be sure to watch this movie. A lot of the old rules for vampires have changed over the years and this will enlighten you to the new rules! Sure, they still do not cast a reflection in a mirror but there are important changes. Boo!","5894":"Interesting characters and an enticing script. Chris Sarandon's portrayal of Jerry Dandridge is a compelling one and he is also one of the sexiest vampires to ever hit the big screen. Roddy McDowell is humorous, compassionate, and fun to watch. I've seen the remake and I still like the original tons better.","5896":"If you like vampires this is a must see! This is one of my favorites. They tried to remake this and ended up doing such a horrible job. Rent it and watch it ... You won't be disappointed!","5897":"this is one of my sons favorite Halloween movies. I personally don't consider it one of my favorites, but, I will watch it because of roddy.","5899":"The actor and actresses in This version of Fright night are more realistic, more frightening, more sexy, less forgettable than the new one that came out more recently.  Been looking for this version for awhile.","5901":"Just have to say that the movie is a really great classic! Cool actors, great plot, no b.s. It's just a movie that must be seen!","5902":"It's the coming of age movie with sex drugs and rock and roll or should I say punk! Very good worth the watch!","5905":"Alice (Milla Jovovich) and Rain (Michelle Rodriguez) are leading a command team into the \"Hive\", an enormous gene labor, where a deadly virus broke out one hour before. The virus killed all scientists in only a few seconds but they are all coming back as flesheating undeads. With little time left, the team has to act fast to avoid disastrous consequences","5907":"This film won a Saturn Award, received a sequel and got a remake (and it looks like a direct-to-video sequel for the remake is in the works). My only complaint is that the extras are light on this DVD. A deluxe Blu-ray with 3 hours of bonus content would be a worthy addition to your library. Fright Night is stuck on DVD for now. It was released on Blu-ray by Twilight Time but went out of print Dec\/2011. It does have a multi-region Blu-ray that can be imported.","5908":"Ah, how can you top Rowdy McDowell in the role of Peter Vincent?  And Chris Sarandon  is waaaaaay too  sexy to be  a vampire.\nThe rest of the cast was  good.  There was nothing scary about the movie, it was more of a comedy I think...but it is fun to watch\nalone...on a dark and stormy night.","5909":"It's such a shame that this classic, campy horror movie can only be enjoyed by the super rich with a limited release by Twilight Time aka Screen Archives Entertainment.\n\nI've noticed a number of studios framing out distribution to other distributors who jack up the prices and only print a limited number of copies. It's a shame the majority of fans can't enjoy them.","5910":"Still one of the best 80's movies!!! Chris Sarandon is on hot vampire and the music is sexy!!  My face part is where he shows up at the club, very seductive!","5911":"This movie did not age well. I loved when I first saw it on cable. Was going to lend it to a friend, to share this great movie. Watching it now its like OMG, I am not lending this to anyone. Ashamed I liked it. Still loved Charlie Brewster and the other characters, but the seduction scenes were creepy, the music was ridiculous.\n  My other guilty pleasure is much better: Disturbing Behavior","5913":"This seems to be like its gonna be one of those lame why did they make it movies, but its not. Its really good and if youve ever been around the true punk seen and have grown up out of it you can truly appreciate this, how some realize they gotta look different to move on and others just rot out. just don't take a hundred hits of acid....stuff is redic!","5915":"if you don't have this video in your library then you should buy it. i watch it every once in a while and still find it funny. some of it can be deep thinking but over all is a comedy and good movie.","5916":"An awesome movie and look into up and coming punks Steve O and Heroin Bob's life in lame Salt Lake City.  You will watch this movie over and over.  I just wish it were available on bluray.","5919":"I own over 1000 movies and am a huge critic to a lot of films but this has to be one of my top 10 of all time\nMatthew lillard really out done himself on acting in this movie, in fact he has never surpassed his role in this film. This is a movie for anyone born in the past 30-35 yrs. please give it a chance, it will be worth your while.","5921":"This was a gift.  Person said it was terrific, just what he wanted.  Has both older and newer versions and had to have both.  No complaints, so evidently good pix, clear, good sound, etc.\nCecy Ivie","5923":"It's so good to have this classic piece of horror history on DVD. The picture is clearer and the sound fantastic. Same cheesy story as ever =)","5924":"I've loved this movie since I was a youngin. It has a lot of cheesy jokes, and cheesy effects, but its still a good movie. Not the best movie ever, but def. worth the watch. Much better then the remake, I think.","5925":"THIS COPY IN BLUE RAY IS RATED A PERFECT 10. IT IS WORTH THE BIG BUCKS, THAT IS WHY I BOUGHT 2 COPIES. YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY BUYING THIS DVD, IT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE IN PEOPLE'S COLLECTION.","5927":"This movie is ok, not gonna win any awards.  There is a lot of talk about punk posers in this movie. This is not about real punk rock.  Which is fitting, because it's about posers.  It's entertaining nonetheless.","5929":"One of the first horror films I watched as a child.  Still great today.  Glad to own a piece of horror history.","5931":"was the greatest movie i seen in a long time and chris sarandon is a fox i just loved it all","5932":"Roddy Macdowall is brilliant as the campy Peter Vincent with Chris Sarandon as the vampire Jerry Dandridge (and yes Colin Farrrel did a good job too) Great makeup great movie.","5934":"This is a well done horror movie. I feel its much better than the remake, and has a surprise that most people may have forgotten. Sure, you have Roddy McDowl as Peter Vincent, but take a look at the female lead in this movie, and then take a look at Married with Children. You'll see what I mean then.","5935":"nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.","5936":"I saw this movie years ago and Chirs Sarandon made a delicious vampire.  Although it wasn't as scary as I would have liked, it was a fun movie.","5937":"I just wish they paired it with Part 2.  I really would like to get my hands on that.  Didn't get that for Christmas this year.","5938":"this is one of my all time favorites. Chris Sarandon and the whole cast played their parts beautifully! I've seen every vampire movie made since the 70's and this one is top 5.","5939":"i love this movie not scary but good seen it in the past i wish the 2nd one would be cheaper so i can buy it","5940":"Splendid combo of horror and comedy. Roddy is excellent as the master of horror. A movie to watch again and again.","5944":"This movie goes all over the place but I think thats the point of\nit all.\n\ngood performances and nice music make this dvd worth it.\n\nEnjoyable and funny commentary also.\n\nAnother little indie gem worth experiencing!!\n\nrecommended.","5945":"50 years from now this is the movie the actors, director, and writer will be remembered for.","5946":"not impressed. This is like a sic-fi channel original movie. bad graphics. cheap story line.","5947":"Very good show","5948":"Shouldn't have to buy movies that are over 10 years old.","5949":"Wonderful movie.","5950":"If you're looking for a great zombie flick to watch and enjoyed resident evil one, this is a must see. Although, it kind of explains the first one so it could be a stand alone movie if you didn't want to watch the first one. All the resident evils after this one are just ok. This movie and the first are must sees.","5951":"HDDVD fanboy\n\nWill play on US HD DVD players","5952":"Love the series","5953":"it's ok","5954":"I love this movie. It is a great movie. Unfortunately $200 for a Blu Ray disc. Someone has to be on drugs to pay so. Amazon should not allow items over price like this one been posted.","5956":"This movie we watch over and over again.... it has everything.... scarey, funny, sexy - you name it.  Chris Sarandon is sooooooo sexy in this movie!","5959":"Upon initially viewing this movie I expected a cheesy story about some punks in Salt Lake City who think that they are better then everyone else.  What I discovered is that this is a deep story about the coming of age of a punk rocker.  I was quite moved by the story and it certainly took turns in unexpected directions.  The acting in this movie is great and you will not regret spending some of your precious time watching this flick.","5968":"Everyone told me about this movie about 2 years ago. I was shocked the first time I saw it. It is a very funny movie, one of the best punk-related movies I've ever seen. It's placed in 1985 and it really makes you feel like you are living in that year. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes punk.","5970":"Very pleased with the item","5971":"Good movie","5972":"I could not finish seeing this, made no sense at all. And Milla does not even seem to be the protagonist.","5973":"It's ok but no story really. I got bored by mid movie","5974":"Satisfied with purchase. Great buy from seller.","5975":"Satisfied with purchase. Great buy from seller.","5976":"Pretty cheesy","5978":"The movie was in good condition.  Fright Night one of those movies that you look at when you want to be scared and laugh during the movie.","5980":"This movie is a typical 80s teenger movie. Kids having sex. Bad things go wrong. Mom and dad are either clueless or out of sight. Anyway, it shows some 80s design if you want to talk that walk back. But the plot is pretty solid. And the one little guy who turns into a vampire . . . is the best!!","5986":"i remember watching this on vhs when my aunt had it. loved it! Chris Sarandon was so sexy playing the vampire. i never knew there was a part 2 to this movie but why is the dvd sixty dollars. guess i have to buy the vhs since its alot cheaper.","5987":"this film is coming to blu-ray through the specialty label Twilight Time in December it was just announced. It will be limited to 3000 copies and sold online at Screen Archives website only.","5988":"Fright Night 1985 is one of a kind, period. Remake or not, which Ive seen...although not bad, still doesn't have the charm the original has. Chris Sarandon as jerry is the perfect person for the role, plus it has the whole 80's feel to it, which of coarse is the best decade for horror...","5989":"Great series!","5990":"Don't care much for zombie-like horror films but Resident Evil has always been an exception. In my opinion, this is the best of the entire Resident Evil series","5991":"i heard they're possibly gonna do a reboot on this, i found it was a good start to the series... now if only its done right maybe with some more facts new one could be even better, this is still an awesome movie","5992":"if you've seen one you.ve seen them all","5993":"this was a great adaptation especially bringing the dreaded nemesis into the picture\ncould take or leave mike epps but he did a descent job\nclaire was spot on along with angela too bad we didn't see more of her after this move","5994":"Excellent","5997":"great movie","6002":"A fun movie all around. The special effects were great and effective. Still a suprise after all these years. The story I thought was excellent. Roddy Mcdowell turned in a great performance, as always. The only thing that bothered me was the powder white hair, and the gastly white make-up they gave Roddy, could have been better. If you have a vampire collection add this movie, you will not be disappointed.","6003":"cult movie. I remember seeing this movie in the theater when it was originally released in the late 80s. I had to have it to compare it to the upcoming remake to be released on August 19, 2011. I can only hope with today's technology, the remake will surpass the original.","6006":"A cheesy old movie that had a lot of sex and violence, cheesy lines and bad special effects.  But, great for Halloween parties in the background...","6010":"THE PICTURE AND SOUND QUALITY IS GOOD. THE MOVIE ITSELF IS PRETTY GOOD CONSIDERING, THOUGH IT'S NO EXORCIST. I AM UPSET ABOUT THE FORMAT. THE ONLY REASON I GOT THIS IS BECAUSE IT STATED IT WAS IN FULL SCREEN AND WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. IT ENDED UP BEING ONLY WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. I WANTED A FULL SCREEN FORMAT. I DON'T LIKE WIDE SCREEN FORMAT. OTHER THAN THE QUALITY OF THE MOVIE AND THE MOVIE ITSELF, I'M UNHAPPY WITH THE TRANSACTION.","6011":"Fun Film,80's teen genre\/vamp movie. Quirky and silly and not too scary, I noticed Amanda Bearse is in it before married with children,it's A fun witty movie so it's not the scariest.","6013":"This is a great movie that is fast paced and with great lovable characters. The movie is fun to watch and the story does have some depth to it. You will cheer loudly when the loser finally becomes the hero. I love the scene where Dracula laughs at the vampire killer who is holding the cross with his shaky hand. That scene is so much fun to watch.\n\n5 stars!  Must see!","6014":"Chris Sarandon, William Ragsdale, Amanda Bearse and Roddy\nMcDowall star in this 1985 horror film. A teen discovers\nthat his new neighbor is a vampire. This is one of the\nbest vampire\/horror films, Chris is terrific as Jerry\nDandridge and Brad Fiedel's score is great. This\ndvd has good picture and sound, but only the\ntrailer. I recommend this 80's classic.","6015":"love this movie the Bluray disk was like new","6016":"Where it all began...WATCH IT...","6024":"I am very satisfied with the DVD. This movie has always been one of my favorites.","6026":"To anyone who has questioned society, this movie is for you.  It asks interesting questions about the way society functions and how everyone is living a life of hypocracy, wheather you're punk or conformist.  It shows a question that has been long asked from a new angle.  The proformances are great, the characters are funny and interesting, and the plot, well, there isn't much of that, but the script itself is good.  Another succesful recomendation from the Sundance Film Festival.","6029":"Great Vampire flick, with lots of \"wink- wink\" humor.  Very well cast, very 80's, very entertaining.","6030":"I really love this movie and I been wanting it on Blu-ray for awhile now the price was alittle steep but it was worth it for me I really love the picture and sound quality too they did a very good job and the extras are good also, no complaints from me","6033":"I  LIKED  THIS  MOVIE  ALOT.  IM  NOT  ONE  FOR  SPOFF  MOVIES BUT  THIS  WAS  GOOD.  TEENS  WOULD  LOVE  THIS  MOVIE.  GREAT  GIFT  IDEA.","6037":"Ol' Charlie has a new neighbor and he turns out to be a blood sucking monster. No one believes Charlie. Not his mother, the police, or his girlfriend. They all believe he is crazy. If only they were right.\n\nThis is a horror classic from the mind of Tom Holland (Child's Play). If you've never seen this 80s incarnation of vampire cinema then you've been deprived. Before Vamp and the Lost Boys was the original horror comedy involving teens and the undead.","6039":"I enjoyed it.","6040":"Zombies, an evil corporation and a hot chick...chubby!","6041":"awesome movies. One recomendation! Resident Evil-a-thon!!!!! Watch them in order best way. These movies kick butt. Alittle gory for kiddos","6042":"Thanks","6043":"A movie I had to own.","6044":"We laughed at the stupidity of this show.","6045":"Not the most interesting film and it appears a little low budget now. But it was entertaining and develops a really good back story","6047":"The 80's will not be remembered for giving us the best of anything,but this little known movie is really a very good entry into the vampire genre. Roddy McDowall,Sarandon and Ragsdale turn in excellent performances and the FX are real good too(esecially for the time). I would like to have seen a better DVD treatment for this forgotten little gem! A great movie to watch on Halloween!","6055":"I just love \"Fright Night.\" This was the last film I saw at a drive in,and I went the next night also. I love scary movies with comedy,and great acting and production. This is a MUST have for you DVD collection.","6060":"In my opinion, the best vampire movie ever made.  The characters are very personable, the plot (if not original) wildly entertaining, and the music (for 80's fans anyway) nostalgic.  The special effects are top-notch, but the movie doesn't rely on them to provide thrills and chills.  I'd be lying if I said I didn't I wish I could jump into this movie and be one of the characters.  It's that good.  Really.","6063":"Not the best Resident evil for sure. There were characters that were more cliche then anything else. But it was entertaining if nothing else.","6064":"But I love all the Resident Evil movies...","6065":"great","6083":"This is one of my faves. I am a huge vampire fan and this ranks the top of my list:) Great movies, special effects, scariness and a touch of comedy. A must see. I am probably bias my name is Amy...I just love hearing Chris Sarandon say my name:) That nightclub scene is a hot one. \" Hey Amanda want to trade with me on that scene:) \"\n A Great Movie...check it out..you'll not be dissapointed..","6087":"loved it","6089":"Love the whole series!!!","6090":"Love the whole series!!!","6091":"like character","6099":"i can even forgive the (nearly unforgivable) cheesy dance club seduction scene (bad!) Roddy Mcdowell is reason enough to see the film...his Peter Vincent, Fearless Vampire Killer is a wonderful character (not to mention a good name!) and you can really see McDowell revelling in the campy over-the-top antics and nature of his character. there are some good laughs, chills and a lot of action in the film.....good stuff!","6100":"This is one of the best films of last year. It is a realalistic look at teen rebelion that doesen't have to dumb itself down to appeal to every  teenage jerk and punk wannabe out there. I think that this covers exactly  how I've been feeling and what I've been thinking about as I get older.  It's also got a great punk music soundtrack. Mathew Lillard (who stars as  Stevo) establishes himself as more than that weird guy in Scream and  instead as a real actor.","6105":"THIS MOVIE TELLS YOU THE WAY LIFE IS.BUY THIS MOVIE.","6110":"I love horror movies. I love black Comady, but \"Fight Night\" had very annoying character's in it. Their's a big difference between funny and annyoing, but not the case of \"Fright Night\". The Vampire in \"Fright Night\" is [bad] when he trys to be funny and very laughable when he trys be scary. I am suprised on how much of a hit \"Fight Night\" actully became. I still suggest you rent this before you buy.","6114":"FRIGHT NIGHT is a halarious horror movie about a teenager named Charlie Brewster, who discovers that his new next-door neighbor is a bloodsucking vampire. In order to stop the vampire from drinking the blood of everyone in town, Charlie enlists the help of Peter Vincent, an actor who has played a vampire killer in many horror films. This is, without a doubt, one of the best horror movies out there!","6120":"I've never played the games but I did enjoy this movie. Lots of suspense!","6121":"Classic start to the series. Still a favorite.","6122":"I'm a fan of the Resident Evil series so yeah I liked it","6123":"Awesome movie!","6124":"Love it","6125":"Great follow up but not as good as the first one","6126":"This little flick has been one of my guilty pleasures ever since childhood.  It is not the greatest movie ever made, but it does deliver on its promise to scare, titillate, and tickle.  Add this 80's classic to the list of really fun B-movies: Flash Gordon, Lost Boys, Buckaroo Bonzai, Vamp, Easy Money, American Werewolf in London, Motel Hell . . . ah, those were the days.  Rather than repeat what many viewers have already said, I'll just give you my favorite scene: Evil Ed, Pencil in the Head.","6137":"Resident Evil Rocks.","6138":"Milla! Don't ever stop making these movies!","6139":"still the only re movie i enjoy seeing. like half of 2  half of 3 and thats about it. im planning to go see final chapter on opening day.","6140":"Good movie","6141":"The step-sister of \"An American Werewolf in London\", in that it mixes legend with humor, but doesn't skimp on the horror.  Both movies have great jokes, good characters, excellent special effects, and plenty of  scares.  Not as funny as the '99 version of \"The Haunting\", but  infinitely more lovable.","6142":"Fright Night is definately a good horror\/comedy film with great special effects. Chris Sarandon (Childs Play) is a suave vampire who is persued by his neighbour who suspects he is a creature of the night. Roddy McDowell as  Peter Vincent, Vampire killer is extremly entertaining and makes the film  what it is.","6143":"I rented this movie to laugh at based on the previews. As it is now one of my favorite horror films and I own the DVD. Great film especially with a  huge bowl of popcorn.","6147":"I really liked this movie.  and was totally amazed at the resemblence bob had to Travis bickle, in taxi driver.  i don't know if that was intentional or not..but i wass blown away! Matthew Lilliard is a very colorful actor  and he really helped the film come to life...  check this one out!","6148":"The only Resident Evil movie worth watching and owning. The movies completely strayed away from what the games were, but Apocalypse was based off of Resident Evil 3 Nemesis, the only movie in the series that was based on the events from the games.","6149":"Recommended.","6150":"Great product and good quality","6151":"Great","6152":"Great","6154":"GREAT VID","6155":"GREAT VID","6156":"Loved and bought the whole series. Milla is energetic and beautiful and plays her part well. Some are better than others, but I'm still waiting for final movie in series.","6157":"Super movie","6158":"Good movie","6159":"Fun game!","6160":"It's over the top, silly fun. I loved this one and the sequels. It's all about the visuals and the action. Top notch stuff!","6161":"Totally met my expectations. Heck I didn't know what to expect! Milla is a bad a** chick! Love seeing women annihilate bad guys..or zombies! Lol!","6162":"I have enjoyed the Resident Evil series of movies","6163":"I have enjoyed the Resident Evil series of movies","6164":"just wanted all the resident evil movies","6165":"Good movie","6166":"So. Good. I marathoned the rest of the films in the first week after watching the original. This 1st installment just has this charm that none of the other films quite capture. And of course, it's the backdrop for the entire franchise. Absolutely would recommend.","6167":"I love the Resident Evil franchise. This one ranks 4 of the 5 for me, though. The other ones are just too good. That said, though, this one is still enjoyable. Milla Jovovich, if you're reading this and you'd like to adopt a 31 year old, I wouldn't say no. PM me, boo.","6168":"ehh","6169":"I'm a sucker for these movies, this wasn't the best but I still liked it.","6170":"liked the move","6171":"liked the movie","6172":"Not into zombie movies but i am into Jovovich","6173":"Bought as a gift for someone and they loved it!","6174":"Bought as a gift for someone and they loved it!","6175":"I still re-watch this & various other zombie movies, or at least have them running as I drink my nightly 6 pack.","6176":"toothpaste?","6177":"Great each time I watch it","6178":"EXCELLENT","6179":"Great","6180":"Great","6182":"Love it!","6183":"every single video game based movie from the super mario bros live action movie to pixels and beyond are the greatest movies in the universe there true classics the best of the best every single video game based movie from the super mario bros live action movie to pixels and beyond rocks, the resident evil movies are the greatest movies in the universe there true classics the best of the best the resident evil movies rocks ^_^","6184":"LOVE DVD MOVIE HAVE ALL OF THE RESIDENT EVILS","6185":"LOVE DVD MOVIE","6187":"Works great","6188":"Wonderful movie","6190":"Perfect!","6191":"I love it.","6192":"It was good","6193":"Great","6194":"Great","6195":"Awesome","6196":"grandkids like it","6197":"Great clarity!","6198":"R E Apocalypse is one of Milla's best performances in the series, the movie it self is the best of the series. I Like!","6199":"you got to have this!!! great","6200":"Went back and watched this recently with a friend who has not scene this movie yet.  I very much enjoyed watching it again.  There are some very classic moments like the laser grid in this movie.\n\nI consider this to be the best adaptation of a game to a movie ever.  I always hope that another game will make the jump to screen effectively, but this is the only one that I feel has met that mark.  Still it is a game to movie, so is not for everyone.","6201":"This is my favorite of the series with a good introduction to the main character, the everlasting plot and the villainous corporation behind the evil.","6202":"good","6203":"ok","6204":"Wonderfully scary.","6205":"Loved it !!!  The action was great","6206":"I liked this movie, it clearly showed what happened in the beginnings of the series.","6207":"Pretty much what I expected; overall well done for the genere.","6208":"thanks you","6209":"Added to my RE collection.","6210":"Added to my RE collection.","6211":"Awesome movie!!!!","6212":"the resident evil movie franchise is the greatest movie franchise in the universe a true classic the best of the best the resident evil movie franchise rocks all the video game based movies that hollywood produced for over 2 decades from the super mario bros movie to pixals are the greatest movies in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the video game based movies that hollywood produced for over 2 decades rocks from the super mario bros movie to pixals rocks","6213":"Great","6214":"Still the best movie in the series.","6215":"great","6216":"love the  movie, love  the  price, love  the service, thx you.","6217":"Part one is cool,kinda thriller -action!","6218":"Just plain fun for Milla Jovovich fans","6219":"Good pacing, great atmosphere, but I'm not a fan of the acting or the way some of the acting sequences are presented.","6220":"Great movie.","6221":"Good scary action movie!","6222":"Awesome","6223":"Enjoy.","6224":"An interesting sequel to the first & really helps to tie into the series would recommend.","6225":"One of my favorites! Plenty of action and Milla rocks.","6226":"very good movie","6227":"Ok movie.  Good for a Friday night.","6228":"This is the 2nd in the franchise and in my opinion the best","6229":"Classic thriller here. Watched in 2015 and still just as good when it came out.","6230":"A little pricey","6231":"Outstanding!! Great Seller!! Highly Recommended!! Thank You!!!","6232":"Good buy.","6233":"Good buy.","6234":"really great skill book to add to my steelbook collection! really fast shipping speed and great seller thank you so much!!","6235":"I like the series.

And Milla Jovovich is in it.","6237":"my least favorite of the four so far.  kind of boring.","6238":"The first in a series of rock-em sock-em action flicks with a strong female lead. Bet you can't watch just one...","6239":"ok","6240":"ok","6242":"This series is very good.","6243":"Good movie","6244":"Best Resident Evil film. Will buy the entire set when they're finished.","6245":"Enjoyed this one as well but more sequels to come.","6246":"I Love the \" Resident \" movies...I overlook some of what might seem dumb things they sometimes do. I dare Anyone to write a decent story where no one....goes to the basement.\nIf you Have written such an impossible thing..I want to read it.\nAs a woman, I also appreciate a lady who can...get er done...not just fall down and scream < yawn >.","6247":"love it","6248":"Great entertainment.","6249":"is okay but not that great","6250":"All good","6251":"As awesome as the others","6252":"A+","6253":"I was satisfied with my purchase.","6254":"AAA","6255":"Cheap case.","6256":"I love movies based on video games","6257":"OK","6258":"OK","6259":"Great!!","6260":"Bad ass movie!","6261":"My boyfriend's Christmas gift. He had the rest just needed this one to complete it.","6263":"perfect","6264":"ok","6266":"Just not that great.","6267":"Excelent Movie. Dubbed in Latin Spanish with Latin Subtitles. 100% Recomended.","6268":"This is a great movie ..fast delivery. .perfect conditions..u MUST buy this movie","6269":"Typical shoot 'em movie from a game that has a lot of unbelievable scenes. The Blu-ray has great extras, the one had the director\/writer explaining how the transfer from game to movie came about. Then there is the usual commentary with the movie. Even if you didn't play the game, this is a good scary zombie type movie.","6270":"Good movie.","6271":"It was okay for a zombie movie.","6272":"SteelBook of Resident Evil is beautiful, this used copy is very good if not better as described by Movie Exchange_Highway6.  Blu Ray inside of SteelBook looks like knew, and the bonus dvd looks good.  Gave me a good deal as well.","6273":"5 STAR - WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY","6274":"The first and the best. You just gotta love Milla....","6275":"An ok movie.","6276":"Ok.","6277":"I love Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez. Both bad asses in a Zombie flick. I love Zombie movies.","6278":"Sweet international trader highly recommended to all.","6279":"Sweet international trader highly recommended to all.","6280":"quick delivery and as described","6281":"yay","6282":"Excellent story. We love it! Arrived in perfect condition.","6283":"Great movie","6284":"Not very good artwork for a great movie.","6285":"very good","6286":"very good","6288":"Very good","6289":"This movie series is an abomination and if you come across any copies please make sure to burn them. A bunch of people making a resident evil movies who have never even played the games. Oh the irony. I bet George A. Romero would've done a much better job. Point is, if you don't know the source material you're basing your work on don't base your work on it.","6290":"the fact is I don't like zombie movies they never say how it all started. at least with resident evil you know how that happens. and yes there is blood but that's not the big thing more movie then gore .","6291":"What's not to love, the first 3 movies are a great stand alone trilogy and since I now have a Steelbook problem I am rebuying the original trilogy again on blu-ray w\/ steelbook, my buddies kid was happy to take my hand me downs.\n\nSo ready for more Milla and Resident Evil's 6th movie coming.","6292":"This movie has been out 12 years and it's still good. The newer Resident Evil movies are better in my opinion, but I just happened to see this one on Netflix and thought I'd give it a go. That being said, I wasn't disappointed.","6293":"that I bought and watched too long ago to remember anything specific to write about. I do not have the time to watch it again just to write a review...","6295":"I completely love this series and need to ad all the movies to my collection!!! I love the action and it really delivers!!!","6296":"I believe we have all the resident Evil movies so you no we had to have this one as well, action packed awesome thank you for my movie it arrived on time and as described","6297":"Great movie. The first of a great series. It has alot of action and supense.  If you enjoy zombies this is a good start to collect all four of them.","6298":"Mila Jovovich is a amazing actress I love everything she is in and Resident Evil is my number film we own 2 copies of each movie and we are waiting for the next movie.","6302":"Loved the movie. Wanted to add to my library, so did, at a very reasonable price.. I am adding more words so will have 20, although I have nothing else to say. Stupid rule.","6303":"Mila can be both victim as well as oppressor. Her skills seem to be ever evolving and the story line is well conceived.","6304":"As always these movies are just awesome always will like these. got a lot of action adventure and zombies in it.","6305":"I always have liked these movies they got action suspense and all the stuff you like in a good scary movie.","6306":"To me this movie is the best in the series, and really nice looking on blu ray.  Not the best blu ray out there but definitely worth it for the price.  If you've never seen this and your a fan of horror you definitely should get this.","6307":"This is one of the few movies that's better than in blue-ray than in normal dvd. The sound, the extras, the colors are all awesome!","6308":"Yuck! Ordered it for my boyfriend he liked it but then only watched half the movie! Not because he didn't want to see it, or didn't\nlike it, just to aggravate me. He woke up in the middle of the night and watched the other half! YUCK! is my opinion!","6310":"I was glad to be able to find it. A great addition to my movie collection. It was in perfect condition.","6311":"A lot of fun!  I enjoyed this movie. If you liked any of the Resident evil movies - you must watch this one!","6312":"I'm late on the Res Evil franchise.  Decided to purchase several to see what I've been missing.  The efx are top notch with more than enough ghouls and dog-like creatures.  Reminds me a bit of the Blade series.  Jovovich and Larter are also easy on the eyes for men that like a little superhero in their woman.\n\nThe blu-ray transfer is good.","6313":"Bought this used, disc was clean and so was the box. save a dollar or two. same features as the dvd so i gave that copy away.","6314":"Delivered on time, Brand new, still with the sticker for a free movie ticket for the 3rd or 2nd underworld movie.\ncame with the same features as the dvd so i gave that copy away.","6315":"Good story, and action.  A dudes movie for sure with the shooting and gore.  I may watch the next one as this was pretty good.","6316":"This is the second resident evil movie. It has it's moments where it gets kinda cheesy but at least it still follows the story of the game. Also it's not as creepy as the first movie, but it's ok on the scare meter.","6317":"Not quite bad enough to be funny, but close.\n\nPretty much nothing in the story makes sense, no-one behaves in a remotely believable way. (People line up peacefully to get let out of a city, with cannibal zombies behind them? People aren't even that polite on the subway).\n\nAtrocious camera work just adds insult to injury. They did manage one rather nice plot surprise that I didn't see coming. About the only good point in the picture.","6319":"To get the movies in steelbook is definitely worth doing, especially if you are a fan of steelbook case collecting!","6320":"To get the movies in steelbook is definitely worth doing, especially if you are a fan of steelbook case collecting!","6321":"gotta love Milla, she is beautiful, intense and the Sigourney Weaver from Alien in the RE series. The girl of a lot of guys, and girls, dreams.","6322":"Enough said. Her and Michelle Rodriguez are some of the hottest actions stars out. Mix in some monsters and winner winner, chicken dinner.","6323":"If you enjoyed the first movie, this is a pretty good sequel. Has more of the zombies plus some new biohazard creatures including some ugly dogs that have been infected.","6324":"I liked the game. I like watching Milla Jovovich. Did not like this movie, however. There are a few neat scenes such as the \"slice and dice\" lasers, but it never caught my attention and held it the whole movie, the way the original Aliens movie did. Just my opinion - take it for what it's worth.","6325":"Was in the mood to watch the Resident Evil movies. Couldn't find them anywhere else but prime allows the instant purchase. I love this feature! :)","6326":"Was in the mood to watch the Resident Evil movies. Couldn't find them anywhere else but prime allows the instant purchase. I love this feature! :)","6327":"I have the Resident Evil movies, but, was missing this one on DVD, After seeing it on HBO, I had to have it.","6328":"this is a replacement, my first one was step on and so I need to replace it. It was cheap","6332":"I love a woman in action film and especially like the actress Milla Jovovich. I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it and would see it over again many times.","6333":"saw the first when it came out love it then bought the second then third had to get one four and five love them all","6334":"very good edition of cult drama!!!","6335":"One of the best prison camp movies ever made.","6336":"ok movie","6337":"Love this movie. Packaged well.","6338":"GREAT PRODUCT SHIPPED VERY QUICKLY NO BAD NEWS","6340":"great film, good condition!","6341":"Although some liberties have been taken from the story this film is based on, the story is pretty interesting. It is a long film though, but then it felt like the ending, with its wrap-up of loose ends, was kind of rushed. The story does illustrate very well the hell of prison, and how one can go pretty much insane inside of one. Pro tip: Dont ever try to smuggle drugs out of Turkey. Maybe just don't try to smuggle drugs, period. Just saying.","6342":"This is the first time we get to see Milla Jovovich with her powers running roughshod over everyone and everything, and it doesn't disappoint. This is a great sequel to the original and sets the table nicely for all the ones that come after it. You do have to see the original to be able to follow, but after you see the first one you definitely ought to see this one and the rest.","6343":"I bought this as part of completing the series. I hadn't seen it since it first came out & watching it I saw many things I had apparently missed the first time I watched. I've watched it a few times since I got this DVD and love it. It has lots of action, keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie.","6344":"it's just what i need v e r y n i c e p r o d u c t","6345":"it's just what i need v e r y n i c e p r o d u c t","6347":"Great","6348":"I saw this years ago and still find this movie amazing, especially since it's a true story.  If you haven't seen this,  get it.","6349":"Great movie. Great transaction.","6350":"Very good movie.\nBased on a true story.","6351":"great condition","6352":"One of the top movies ever released, I watch it time and time again, and never tire of it.","6353":"Good movie.","6354":"Received quickly and perfect.  This is a movie you will never forget.","6355":"This is a good zombie film, plain and simple. The Resident Evil content is really irrelevant. But, beware, some of the scenes are SO BAD that they'll make you groan (like the motorcycle jumping into the middle of the church and then blowing up--so stupid it'll make you wonder if it meant to be funny). Overall, it's a video game film, based on a zombie video game. You just can't have too many expectations. It's fun to watch M-J do her thing, not much more you can say because there is no plot.","6356":"Didn't know what to expect with the first one, but you have to see it to really understand and appreciate the sequels. Plus, hard not to love Milla Jovovich fighting for her life.","6357":"If your a huge \" Resident Evil \" fan get this steel book edition before it's sold out. It's glossy , reflective look and cold metal to the touch feel fits perfectly with the Resident Evil franchise.","6358":"The entire time of being a Resident Evil fan, I had never watched this one for some reason.  I'm glad I bought it!","6359":"The original Resident Evil movie play enough homage to the game that it satisfied the gamer in me and was enough of a departure to make it a really interesting movie. From the third movie forward it feel more like the movies influenced the games more so than the other way around. After \"Afterlife\" these movies are great action movies that seamlessly roll from one into the other.","6360":"I would have to say this is the best resident evil movies plenty of action and milla is at the top of her game beautiful as always","6361":"I'm a fan of prison movies and this is the best.","6362":"Work great","6363":"Not as entertaining as it used to be.","6364":"I like Midnight express.","6365":"A triumph! A classic!","6366":"Love this movie glad i found it its not to easy to find ty :)","6367":"NO.","6368":"I would recommend this to Resident Evil fans. It does not follow too closely to the games but has some similar scenes. Not a bad sequel, overall 4 stars.","6370":"I am a Milla Jovovich fan and would pretty much watch any movie she does.  That being said, I am not necessarily a fan of Zombie movies, but the Resident Evil series is the best I have seen.  The production values are always good (sound, visuals, lighting, etc) and the stories are good considering the subject.  I have the entire series on Blu-Ray, and from time to time I will watch the movies as a marathon.  I always see something I missed in prior viewings.","6371":"I am a Milla Jovovich fan and would pretty much watch any movie she does.  That being said, I am not necessarily a fan of Zombie movies, but the Resident Evil series is the best I have seen.  The production values are always good (sound, visuals, lighting, etc) and the stories are good considering the subject.  I have the entire series on Blu-Ray, and from time to time I will watch the movies as a marathon.  I always see something I missed in prior viewings.","6373":"I love the action in this film the story line is not so far fetched either! I never played the video game but the movie franchise is solid!!!","6374":"Product was as advertised. Brand new","6375":"great movie!!!","6376":"nice and clean transfer","6377":"Not true to actual facts","6378":"Funny update of the Cyrano de Bergerac story.","6379":"I like it","6380":"One of Steve's best rolls.","6381":"Excellent Production","6382":"It makes me proud to live in America. This is a classic film about a good kid getting caught up in the drug culture in Turkey. His life will never be the same.","6384":"Replacing an old VHS with the much-needed DVD. I've always thought this was Steve Martin's best movie, perhaps because of the classic upon which it's based. The scene of 20 ways in which to describe his nose is a film classic. The problem of drinking a glass of wine was also cleverly written and brilliantly acted.","6385":"Although it's a bit goofy in places, this is a terrific adaptation of the Cyrano de Bergerac story by Steve Martin.  In Blu-ray, the colors are vivid and the sound track clear and clean.  Overall, Steve Martin has done an excellent parody on the Cyrano story.","6386":"Good movie.","6387":"Loved this movie.","6388":"Great 80's flick","6389":"One of the best True Stories ever made into film. A must see.","6390":"Great DVD and excellent service. Thank you!","6391":"...I never ordered his disc and do not know how it is in my Past Orders -- I know I saw this film once -- in the theater upon its initial release -- and once was enough. Had its moments -- but a  long -- dark -- unsavory tale. -- nK","6392":"Suspenseful and riveting.  The main character in the movie did something very wrong, but the way he was treated in a foreign prison just because he was American justifies his prison escape.  There is no place like America when it comes to justice and a fair trial, and a jury of your peers to determine your fate.  The corruption in overseas court systems seals the fate of many innocent and penitent people.  The pig who was the prison warden got what was coming to him for his violence and hubris.","6393":"Scary and true but they should have used an actor that looked more like the blond blue eyed kid that did it.","6394":"All excellent.","6395":"I remember this film when it was in the movie theaters back in the seventies and how totally intense it was on the theater screen. This is a must film for any movie collection and I highly recommend it to watch.","6397":"We love these movies. I know its 2013 and we are just watching all the Resident Evil movies..lol\nIts a time of Zombies!","6398":"If you are a concrete thinker and do not \"get\" films made from video games or comic books, nor their intent, then are comments like \"avoid this trash\" necessary? Sure, nonsense is probably accurate but this movie is excellent for fans of the genre and of course Milla.","6399":"The original and the best. All the sequals they've made cant compare to the first one. I never get tired of watching this.","6400":"This is a movie that has to be evaluated against expectations.  It is not a cinematic masterpiece, but if you are looking for a good popcorn action flick, you could do worse.  The movie occasionally has some internal contradictions, but you don't want to overthink a movie in this genre.  Sit back, accept the premise, and enjoy the next hour and a half.  The movie improves as Milla Jovovich's role in the story expands.  The HD transfer looks great and the sound is impressive.","6401":"Each Resident Evil Movie get better each time. I love this movie. I would recommend to anyone who is fan of Resident Evil","6402":"The price was good very cheap and in HD and in HD look great thank you ,you need to get all if you are fan of this movies","6403":"It's okay","6404":"A 70's classic!","6405":"Well written with a strong cast.","6406":"Great movie at a great price, especially when you consider that it's on Blu-Ray, and that it comes with a 32 page hard cover booklet in color.\nDefinitely recommended.","6407":"Excellent","6409":"If you're a fan of Alan Parker's cautionary tale about an American lad caught trying to take narcotics out of Turkey in the 1970's, you'll want to pick it up on BluRay. The movie has never looked better than it does in this pristine hi def transfer. Anybody travelling to parts of the world where there is little tolerance for drug crime should be made to watch this film. Essential viewing.","6410":"Ugh.","6411":"Lightweight fun comedy.  Martin at his best.","6412":"Happy movie","6414":"Very good movie and the price totally worth it.","6415":"Rated already.","6416":"One of the most original, dramatic films that I have every watched.  After purchasing this, I viewed this film for the first time since it's release.  Wow!!  I was really amazed how the story line holds it's through the test of time.  It really competes with great films about inmates suffering and escaping.  if you've never watched this film, you won't be disappointed.  I just can't believe it took me over twenty years to see such an exciting film!  The digibook is a proud piece in my collection.","6417":"One of the best movies of the 70's. And on Blu-ray ? Even better. A must have in your collection.","6418":"top 10","6419":"SUSPENSEFUL DRAMA OF A YOUNG MAN WHO ENDS UP IN A TURKISH PRISON FOR RUNNING HASH...NOT A BORING MOMENT IN THE FILM!","6420":"Good lighthearted Rom-Com,riddled with classic trademark Steve Martin comedy","6421":"One of Steve Martin's best films - a retelling that is better than the original.","6422":"One of my favorite movies.","6423":"A Steve Martin favorite at our house","6424":"I've always loved this movie. It's just a quirky, feel good, love story.  Every character is entertaining.","6425":"Too funny! Steve Martin is a genius, for sure! A comic genius! I laughed out loud so many times!!! A mood lifter! One of the best romantic comedies out there! And I want to own all the good ones, because I love to LAUGH with my family!","6426":"I love it great product A + + + + +  + + + + + + + ++ +","6428":"I need to get this on blue ray, because this is still the best in this movie series!!! This one is as close as it will get to the games!!!","6429":"I bouth this movie, because I like it. I Recomemmed this product because I think is a good movie to see","6430":"I rate this product with 3 stars as I like it, is a good movie to see I recomen it","6431":"When compared to other films in the genre, one would be hard pressed to find 1 or 2 that are superior. Highly recommend this film and don't worry if you never played the video game. This film stands on its own merit.","6432":"I love this movie. Anyone into the whole zombie outbreak would too! Think about it, a lab comes up with a virus that makes people live after death... it's a curious twist on the zombie tale with a bit of revenge mixed in.","6433":"Milla is the zombie killing queen. This flick was her boot drive. She can jump in my shower anytime. Where can I get one of those dogs?","6434":"I got Roxanne because it is a movie I have lived for a long time. Such a great movie!","6435":"Classic","6436":"Great movie","6437":"Jose Ferrer was better in the old version, but this was a nich variation for young folks and those who have no interest in seeing the classics.","6438":"Steve Martin at his best.  A very funny, yet touching movie.","6439":"Outstanding Film! This movie gave me nightmares, and even though its a few hours away, I never want to visit Turkey.","6440":"Excellent script and music, both of which received Oscars. All-star. Anamorphic widescreen picture looks great.","6441":"Thx","6442":"great movie prompt service","6443":"loved it","6444":"Great show","6445":"Great movie. No complaints...","6446":"Very good movie, as an Israeli, I love the actor who play the main prison guard who is an Israeli actor that play in lots of movies in Israel in the early 70.","6447":"Steve Martin, like Robin Williams is a comedic genius.  That means that he can play drama and tragedy better than actors who can only do drama and tragedy.  Yes, there are plenty of yuks, but there is also a warmth that few other actors can reach in a comedic performance.  Sniff at it, if you will, but in the end, it is Martin's character who takes the also wonderful tragedy that is Cyrano de Bergerac (1950), and turns it into a posy of hope, promise, and winning by a nose.","6448":"Classic Steve","6449":"Really funny 80's movie and great take on a classic.  Some language may be inappropriate for kids though","6450":"It took weeks to get over it.","6451":"Classic","6452":"great movie","6453":"darn good true story","6454":"I read the book years ago and the movie adaptation is very close.  Rule #1 Do no try to smuggle drugs in or out of any country especially Turkey.","6455":"A+A+A+","6456":"order came in a timely fashion and was exactly what i wanted.","6457":"An excellent \"upgrade\" of this sensational film!","6458":"Good movie which would be great if it didn't have so many obscenities. The storyline is taken from the classic play Cireno de Bourgeoirac.","6459":"I love this movie. It has more depth to it compared to other Steve Martin movies. It's a sweet love story based on Cyrano D'Bergerac but with a happy ending.","6460":"good story,","6461":"SHOULD BE  10","6462":"Whoa, does not hold up. It's so dated. I cannot believe the things I used to think were funny. There are some funny parts and some cute parts but it's not very good in this day and age.","6463":"Good fun","6464":"For me this is the finest film Martin ever shared his comedic talents in. The story line is a loose following the classic Cyrano de Bergerac, and all the character actors shine without a dud. Beautifully filmed in Canada (BC), there is a beauty and fantasy bling throughout coupled with well timed humor as Martin pursues Daryl Hannah's character. While the outcome is predictable, it never impedes the enjoyment of being entertained.","6465":"My son is currently plopped on the couch with his psp in hand watching his movie. Very happy I got it.","6466":"This was the first Resident Evil  film that I had ever watched. Found it to be very interesting. Really I enjoyed it!","6467":"Action packed sequal.  If your are wondering what happened after see got out of the hospital watch this movie.  It has more characters and events that explain the aftermath.","6468":"the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad","6469":"This is definitely worth it. It was a great price and I was very satisfied with my purchase :) It comes with a slip cover and all the special features. Perfect for any Resident Evil fan :D","6470":"oh Billy...","6471":"got to go with the book good picture love brad davis","6472":"great price","6473":"knew i'd like it.","6474":"Great Classic, kids loved it.","6475":"Classic Steve Martin.  Funny and entertaining.","6476":"AWESOME!","6477":"love it","6478":"\"it is the one of the best movies ever made!\"","6479":"ok","6480":"REALLY GREAT MOVIE,  AN EYE OPENER !!!  SCARRY TO SEE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IN ANOTHER COUNTRY!!!\nA MUST SEE MOVIE, AND ONE TO HAVE IN YOUR DVD COLLECTION!!!","6482":"A great movie and scary and disturbing","6483":"DVD came promptly. It's a 70's movie I wanted quite a bit. Perfect condition. There were no issues here. I like the fact that things come ahead of schedule.","6484":"another sunday afternoon movie, curl up on the couch with a bag of chips and dig in visually on the film and dig into the bag of chips with your hands!\nand brad is stimulating, good looking man!","6485":"Great sequel.  Cannot wait to see the other movies. Love the concept.  Was watching the walking Dead and thinking it is a great concept, but watching the Resident Evil series tells me this concept has been around for a long time.  Love the action in this movie.","6486":"This is ok ... the following series are great. You have to watch this to understand the movies after this one. this sets the plot.","6487":"GOOD MOVIE IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT IT ISNT WAS TO T","6488":"GOOD MOVIE I WAS WAS YEP IT IS WAS WE I TO TOO TWO ONE TWO TREE IT IS IN","6489":"This version has been edited...I'm guessing..per Millia's request...aka shower scene is almost completely gone.\nGranted it is a nudity scene yes, however I don't want to pay of something that has been edited down...if I didn't want blood, sex and violence I'd watch network tv.","6490":"Hello I'm telling you the order arrived and everything is in perfect condition. I'll keep buying more stuff. They are of very good quality. 100% recommended.","6491":"This is another excitng movie from MILLA JOVOVICH the modern day Lauren Bacal. Talented in every way to give a performance that stays in the audiences mind for ever.","6493":"Why was Brad Davis not nominated for an Oscar for this?? He's terrific in the role. As are John Hurt and Randy Quaid.","6494":"If you've never seen it before, you should watch it.  Mostly based on a true story.  Give it a try.","6495":"Although the DVD appears to be homemade the quality is Good.  The movie is entertaining and quite well done.  The acting is excellent.","6496":"great flick","6497":"Excellent story!!!","6498":"clever","6499":"I love this movie, and now that I bought it through Amazon on Prime I got the widescreen version. The picture is amazon.","6500":"I'm not that fond of Steve's sense of humor, but this is a good remake of Cyrano.","6501":"I can't watch this because it's based on a true story.  I would prefer fiction.  My guy loves this movie, though.  He watches it when I'm not home.  It's painful and scares me to death.  Too real for my taste.","6503":"very good movie. made back when Hollywood was still putting out entertainment and not the CGI junk they have today.","6504":"One of the worst cases of torture documented. The first time I had seen this, I was aghast by under what conditions a human being can be exposed to and survive. Billy Hayes displays true courage and strength under unbearable circumstances. The audience will be horrified at what horrific incident will be coming next.","6505":"This is just such a great movie. Almost worth the price of admission purely on the strengths of the opening sequence of Martin vs. Nealon\/Shydner and Martin suggesting the older women go looking for the aliens at Roxanne's house.\n\nBut, imo, and inventive reinterpretation\/update of the classic tale.","6506":"Roxanne is Steve Martin at his sweet, romantic best (although he is equally so in It's Complicated).  For those not familiar with this movie, it's an updated version of the Cyrano de Bergerac story:  the Martin character has a huge nose that makes him think no woman could love him, he pines for Roxanne, and pens love letters for Roxanne's would be moron paramour.  We all know how it ends, and it's still a great tale.  And if you *don't* know how it ends, well, get it now!","6507":"Has always been a favorite movie.  I was so excited to find it on DVD","6508":"couldn't wait to get this one in the dvd player. wow","6509":"funny","6510":"rOCK'N GOOD TIME.\njUST PLAIN KICKS !\ni LOVED EVERY MINUTE OF IT.\nmILA ROCKS IN THIS ROLE!\nI must say it was a great time!","6512":"We love all of the movies in the Resident Evil series and are big zombie movie fans. Resident Evil is definitely our favorite in the Zombie movie genre of films.\n\nWe had this DVD and broke it during a move so I needed to replace it. I purchased a new one and it arrived quickly to our home and in perfect condition.","6514":"I've recently sat to watch for the first time all of the resident evil series.  It's no wonder that people love the movies, there's enough suspense, campy undead, action, feminine vulnerability coupled with a kickass attitude for most people who like a movie to entertain them.  As they series progresses, so does the development of Alice's character.  Yet in this first installemnt - I can appreciate the initial concept and the \"coming into oneself\" aspet of who Alice is.\n\nA very fun movie.","6517":"Moral of story don't traffic drugs in a muselim country.because the jails are scum.watch this movie the best way to open your eyes of how horrific things are in those jails.&how it will change you bit by bit.&itl show the legal corruption.&it makes u think y this is.even better watching it the 2nd time just wish it showed how he got home.","6518":"I HAD THIS MOVIE ON VHS, I WATCH IT SO MUCH, THAT I HAD TO HAVE IT ON DVD..THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE.","6519":"had it on vhs and now dvd.  saw a reminder that it was available and i bought it.","6520":"One of my favorites. Always wanted to run it through computer and edit it about for viewing with small grandkids but never got around to it and tape player no longer works well so stuck.","6521":"Good movie, good actors. Even had a lesson that could be learned. I enjoy this movie.","6522":"Extremely inaccurate representation of a country! People who have some awareness and information about the other nations will know what I mean after watching the movie!","6523":"I liked this film when I first saw it at a movie house long long time ago and then I purchased this blu ray\nbut the picture quality of this blu ray is quite disappointing because I can't find any better picture quality\non this blu ray compared to any other DVDs.","6527":"This movie is an old classic. True, mostly, story of a dude that got caught smuggling hashish in turkey in the 70's. What a scary nightmare. Makes you very nervous about going to another country!!","6528":"This is such a funny movie = I am a Steve Martin fan and he does a good job in this film.\nLots of good laughs without  all of the over-drama that so many other movies need as they try to be funny.\nDaryl Hannah is good in this one too. Cute little love story.....","6529":"It is a fun steve martin movie. If you like steve Martin this is a fun movie.","6530":"Steve Martin at his finest! Funny and romantic, a great date movie.","6531":"Steve Martin playing a moderately \"straight\" character compared to the rest of the foils he's set against.  The sight gag of his ginormous nose is greatest when he's sitting at home with a bird perched on it and muttering the teasing remark that he'd made about it when accosted in the bar.\n\nSplash veteran, Daryl Hannah, plays the romantic lead that is drawn to the moronic eye-candy as Martin plays the Cyrano role to comic delight.","6532":"Great movie! Love it.","6533":"Steve Martin remakes classic tale. Love this movie!","6534":"fast shipment, thank you AAAA++++","6535":"Replacing VHS tape.","6536":"I watch this wonderful movie when I need a pick-me-up.  Never gets old and is always funny.","6537":"Steve Martin at his best.","6538":"For the smart, beautiful unicorn I know is out there; You'll know why you're the living incarnation of Roxanne to all us Cyrano's :-)\nBrilliant!","6539":"Even though this movie is some years ago I still find it relevent today. I was of age to see this movie when it was first made but honestly don't remember it. I was watching TV late one night and my friend brought it up in conversation and within minutes this movie actually came on cable. After seeing it I just had to purchase it and very glad to have it in my selection of great movies.","6543":"This movie is absolutely fantastic. Just having the Nemesis is this movie is worth 5 stars. He looks incredible. I liked the first movie alot, but I love the second one. Anyone who has not seen this has to check it out. Having Mike Epps in it helps out to, he is a great comedian.","6544":"I love the video game series. I still remember buying Resident Evil 2 when I was a teenager and taking it home and playing it for the first time. It just sucked me in instantly and before you know it I was out looking for the first one. This movie is no different. It sucks you in from the very beginning and doesnt let up till the end. It is a fantastic action\/horror\/sci-fi movie that is filled with great special effects. If you are a zombie or video game lover this film is for you.","6548":"Steve Martin shows his writing genius","6549":"Huge fan of Steve Martin.  Watch it all the time.","6551":"No problems. Fast delivery.","6552":"Steve Martin at his best.","6553":"goog movie","6555":"very funny movie","6556":"Not his best work.","6557":"I am really disappointed by the poor transfer of this BR release. There is no need to buy the BR version if you have the DVD.","6561":"Good deal for a good movie.","6562":"It still has it all. Great music, lots of drama and emotion too. Such a shame Brad Davis died so young he really was a talented actor. Billy's pain and anguish has just as much impact as the first time I saw it.","6563":"good","6564":"Funny but I had forgotten how many sexual references there are!  A good story overall, just not for kids.","6565":"great movie!","6566":"Fun movie, good price and customer service.","6568":"WATCH IT !!!","6569":"Based on the true story of would-be drug smuggler Willaim Hayes, screenwriter Oliver Stone goes way over the top here with courtroom theatrics, sensational violence, and an overt chauvanism towards Turks in this portrayal of the Turkish prison system as a kind of hell on earth. On the plus side: great locations (Instanbul and Malta), beautiful photography, and good acting, help create a sense of atmosphere.","6573":"This DVD was great to see again and came to me as promised. Very good DVD and in excellent shape. I cant say enough.","6574":"I love this movie; it's a survivor's movie.  The acting is great; I could feel the intensity of the rage and terror.  Be careful, though, if you're disturbed by violence and abuse.","6575":"Movie is great, always a fan of Resident Evil the Video game... and in blu ray wow, looks great!! i own all 4 of them and they are great! hope they come out with a new one soon!!!","6576":"Movie is great, always a fan of Resident Evil the Video game... and in blu ray wow, looks great!! i own all 4 of them and they are great! hope they come out with a new one soon!!!","6577":"Great movie, looks great in our blu-ray player with our 37\" lcd tv. couldn't be happier with the great price for this movie!","6578":"Great movie, looks great in our player with our 37\" lcd tv. couldn't be happier with the great price for this movie!","6579":"The movie \"Resident Evil\" was very good\nand I had very high hopes for this sequel.\nWhat a disappointment.\nI do not even want to waste much time on a review\nbecause I wasted far to much time watching the movie.\nThere is not one good thing that I can recommend\nabout this one. It is poor in every aspect.","6581":"Great funny movie before Steve Martin decided to become a dramatic actor! He's funny in this show!  Seems like he's lost his sense of humor for good!","6582":"My Order Came in on time. I like the Show. Thank you","6583":"Great film! My boys lived it. 8 and 9 yr old.","6584":"A Top 5 film in the Martin collection....a great modern day tale of a classic story......and beautiful Darryl Hannah.....a great story that flows really well, seen it many times, and still love it.....one to be added to any collection.","6585":"This is a hilarious.  Steve Martin is entertaining here, and so are the other firefighters.  This movie is very romantic and Martin's character is very charismatic and poetic.  And the music during the credits I dig.  80s sound mixed with comtemporary jazz.","6586":"Arrived early, great condition. Great movie for a great price.","6594":"A great retelling of a classic!","6595":"Arrived on time had different artwork haven't played yet","6596":"Loved it.","6597":"This is one of Steve Martins best films!  No one could have made this better than him.  Full of humor, warmth and cheer!  Darryl Hannah is great in it too.  I watch every so often when I want cheering up!","6603":"This biography is a true story about a young American who gets caught in Turkey (right before he boards the plane to go home) smuggling drugs. The movie moves a bit slow after authorities incarcerate him. Makes me think twice about traveling to third-world countries. Good drama and descent story. BEST screen play I have ever seen. Though there should be a remake of the movie to spiff it up a little more.","6605":"This movie is entertaining, fight scenes, gory dead, grusome dogs (yes ewww) and some revelations you will need for the next movie. Even though I did not give the first movie a good review, these are at least entertaining.","6606":"This BD has great video and audio quality. The story is just, ok. Seems the story has been done before, govt experiments unleash a killer virus, kills then brings you back to life, this time we don't stop it. This movie I think is the best of the first three.","6607":"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.\n\nThe video quality was excellent, although it was 1.85:1, instead of the 2.40:1 I prefer.  The Dolby TrueHD 5.1 was also excellent.\n\nThe movie was okay; not great.","6608":"This film has hot chicks, and it has zombies. That's really all you need in order to make a good movie. Buy this.","6609":"This film has hot chicks, and it has zombies. That's really all you need in order to make a good movie. Buy this.","6610":"Steve Martin is great in this movie and show a flawless ability for amazing comedic timing. Have always loved this one!","6611":"This movie can be watched over and over again, and remains a wonderful mix of spectacular humor, silliness, pathos, and love. It is an almost perfect blend of all of the above. Darryl Hannah does an acceptable job, and Steve Martin is absolutely perfect.","6612":"I love this movie and I am so glad to have it on blu ray. Steve Martin is so funny in this movie","6613":"The acting is outstanding , the story may be similar, but not with Steve Martin on board. I espically like the fire department","6614":"it funny because you do not sea a man at all with a long noise like he has\nand you do not now how you well you would go with one but he can some how\nI whatched this movie when I was 6 it always mad me laugh it shourly will make you laugh","6615":"This movie is all about Steve Martin and the character he plays.  He is wonderful and I wish there were more movies of this kind around with Steve in them.  He is the Movie.  Get it.","6616":"It's funny, has great dialogue, good acting and beautiful scenery.  None of the characters are disrespected.  Unlike the play by Cyrano de Bergerac, this has a happy ending.","6622":"Awesome old movie. It is De Brezherac, but its also king Tut playing him! Almost nothing Steve Martin made is not worth seeing. This film more than once for me and mine.","6623":"Picture appears out of focus most of the time= I still like the movie but even on upconverting dvd player, there is an aggravating blurriness going on. Maybe I should have ordered the blu-ray instead.","6624":"replacing VHS movies and this was one of them. Besides Wal-Mart was a little pricey for an older movie I think.","6627":"I love Resident evil and purchased this since my old copy had stopped working. I figured I would buy the deluxe instead of just the normal DVD but I must say there is honestly no difference what so ever and I would suggest just buying the normal DVD instead of the deluxe. But it did arrive very quickly and well packaged. I was just disappointed that the deluxe did not really have anything different or extra then just the regular copy.","6638":"This is a good movie and a funny movie. As far as funny is concencerned I have said before that every movie Steve Martin is in is funny except  one and this is not that exception. It is also a love story however and I don't think Steve was in too many of those. This actuactally follows the Cyrano Story to the T. You should get this especially if you like love stories.","6639":"LOVE Steve Martin - intelligent comedian. No other person could have made this movie work so well.  It's a classic.  Our family laughed hard.  Yet, Steve Martin knows how to make you laugh and then touch a tender part of you.  He's a good actor.","6640":"I loved this movie, but the only version is full screen, not widescreen. Worthless now that almost everyone has a widescreen TV.","6641":"A fine adaptation of a classic story.","6642":"I love the movie but the actual Blu Ray case it comes in is a nightmare!  Just the first day since it arrived and I have already cut my fingers twice just opening the case!  I'll probably end up tossing the case and putting the dvd in another, more user friendly case.","6646":"It's not a noun, it's not a verb ... I don't know what it is ....\nI watch this movie over and over again. Steve Martin at his best, brightest, funniest and most intelligent, and that's saying a lot. This movie knocks it out of the park, and that's coming from a fan of the Gerard Depardieu version of Cyrano de Bergerac. Outstanding.","6647":"As a teacher of Literature I really enjoy the contemporary version, ok - it's the 80's version - but all in all it does show the traits of both primary characters and clarifies what many students might not completely grasp of understand from the original play.","6648":"Loved this flick as Steve Martin does a great job with his character.  Highly recommended and very funny.  If you get a chance, check it out!.","6652":"This is one of the most important movies ever made, in my opinion. There seem to be a few people who don't like this movie and\/or think it's silly. You have to think of something: you don't know how much Hayes might have suffered. I can understand that the Turks don't like this movie, but I myself think it's a masterpiece.","6656":"Resident Evil is arguably the best zombie game series of all time,before Dead Rising and House of the Dead. The story starts off showing how the T virus was started in the hive by someone close to umbrella and why. Will let you find out the rest from there. Claire and Chris unfortunately do not appear in the movie, however Milla Jovavich took my attention away from the missing characters. She is the real deal. Sorry guys she's all mine!","6659":"As an avid Resident Evil (video games) and Milla Jovovich fan, my 5 stars could certainly be a biased opinion. I enjoyed seeing more of the story, surrounding the games and I really enjoyed the acting on everyone's parts and I enjoyed the action scenes.  This movie is far superior to the next movie in the line \"Resident Evil: Extinction\". That was in one word: Awful. Zombies don't wear jumpsuits! Why are they in jumpsuits!?","6660":"It's good with enough action, but I think they went a little overboard with the superpowers. But the additional cast who portray good guys does give it more fun to watch.","6661":"One of my favorite actress's from Hottiewood is the lead in this movie, Milla Jovovich. She,in this movie,is just get'n primed for the next two sequels. There, she shows off her great fighting skills. There is so much more good entertainment on this dvd. Now one of my favorites. To me, it makes me wonder does that stuff by the umbrella corp. actually go on somewhere in this world?","6662":"WOW! I'm get'n to be a big fan of the Resident Evil&nbsp;<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Resident-Evil-Apocalypse-Special-Edition\/dp\/0767834739\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Resident Evil - Apocalypse (Special Edition)<\/a>&nbsp;Series. So far they haven't disappointed me. Entertainment in this DVD is worth it. I would want Alice on my side! Go Miljo!","6666":"This is such a wonderful movie, it really reminds me of my childhood.  This was in perfect condition, got to me very fast.  Thank you so much, This is a great person to buy from and the movie is wonderful","6667":"An excellent acting job by Steve Martin, among his best.  A funny movie that carries a needed message about judging one only on their physical attributes. Fun to watch with a pleasing yet surprising ending.","6668":"Roxanne arrived from Amazon earlier than promised.  The Blu ray disk was in excellent condition upon arrival. The picture of this blu ray is pretty good and the sound was also pretty good.","6669":"I enjoyed it.  Its not something to watch more than afew times; Daryl Hannah is good in it and so is Steve Martin.","6670":"Ive loved this film since it was released and always had a soft spot as it was mainly filmed in BC Canada. This blu ray release really shows you how nice this country is and the outdoor scenes are breathtaking.\nEven if you have the dvd, this is worth the cost of getting another in blu ray.","6671":"What a wild and wacky place to find a Fire Chief and a Rocket Scientist, both looking for love.  Steve Martin is in excellent form as is Darryl Hannah.  The town becomes part of the ensemble, too.  Highly recommended, especially if your significant other watches with you.","6680":"Steve Martin is C.D. Bales, a perfect catch for any woman except for one drawback. He has a huge nose. Everyone is hypnotized by it. No one can ignore it. The movie is a take-off on the play, Cyrano de Bergerac. C.D. works for the fire department and falls for Roxanne, an astronomy student. Because of his nose, he courts her through a friend. Romance and humor intertwine. The scene in which Martin enumerates insults about his nose is brilliant.","6681":"I loved this movie when I was younger. It's still magical, but for whatever reason, it isn't the five star film I remembered.  That's alright because it's still a good date movie if you want to stay home.  My one big quibble is that the special feature section is so minimal.  The studios should really go back and give these classic old movies the proper treatment they deserve.","6684":"I'll be honest, I'm not a really zombie\/mutant monster film fan. This is one of three that I like. Not really overly gory. Decent characters and a good back story makes this film a good watch. One of the better based on a video game films I've seen.","6685":"I enjoyed the series of Resident Evil. I bought the DVD before and decided to buy the Blu ray to see the difference. A 61 inches DLP did tell the difference between the picture quality of DVD and Blu Ray. It is fun to watch and the special effect still look good.","6687":"It wasn't a perfect movie, but I cant understand the relentless bashing of it either. I thought it followed the plotlines (and characters\/monsters) of the game a lot closer than the first (which I think was a good thing). Maybe I'm just an unashamed fan of the VG, but I thought this was the better effort of the series. It is what it is...a fairly cinematographic, fast paced popcorn movie.","6688":"Love this series of movies I think the plot in each one is fabulous and MIla does a great job.","6694":"He had very long nose, his buddies don't know what to do,or put out a fire if they found one. Her head is in the stars. Funny movie","6695":"Cyrano is the classic chick-plot of all time.  And nobody could retell it like it is retold here.  The sexual inuendo in places cost this one a star in my rating but otherwise this is a wonderful romantic comedy with a wonderful retelling of an age-old classic tale.","6699":"This movie is a MUST see for people that have low self esteem for one reason or another. The location it is filmed is just perfect and the way Steve Martin acts is as if he was born with such a nose. If you can buy this movie go ahead you will not regret it.","6703":"This is the best modern zombie movie,zombies are basicaly the same as Romeros zombies but of course with a lot of new things. For zombie fans this is a lot better than the remakes they did of the classics,this is something new,and the sequels are good too.","6704":"This movies is one of the best Sci-fi genre movies. If you like action and surprises and suspense then you should watch this movie. This is definitely the best of the three movies. So if you haven't seen this movie, you NEED to!!! This is one of my favorite movies and I tell all of my friends about this movie. I give it a 10 out of 10!","6707":"It was a fun movie looking forward to seeing the next ones. My son told me about them and just had to watch them. Great.","6708":"This is the first of three movies on the Resident Evil series.  Resident Evil is a great movie about a virus that turns people into flesh eating zombies, once you get bitten you get the virus.  This is one of the best Zombie movies out there, if you love Zombie movies you will love this move, great cast of actors also.","6709":"This review has nothing to do with the movie, i love Resident Evil. But the Blu Ray transfer is bad,bad,bad......!!!!!!!\n\nAfter watching Dark Knight, i watched Resident Evil... Lo and behold the vast difference of the two. Dark Knight has superb picture quality but Resident Evil is Grainy.. Stick to the DVD is my recomendation...","6714":"An updated (and English!) version of Cyrano de Bergerac, this movie is wonderful.  Steve Martin really shines as a self-effacing Fire Chief, and Darryl Hannah is always fun to watch.  The humour (most of which surrounds Steve Martin's large nose) is funny but never interferes with the true love story at the heart of this movie.","6724":"First of, I am not a gamer, and am not familiar with the game. This was the first time I watched this Blu-Ray. Equipment used to watch, is Panasonic 42\" Plasma, BD30K Blu-Ray player and Onkyo 605.\n\nThe story was engaging in that it was futuristic, and had some cool effects (although over computerized). I am rating it 3 stars, for the story and overall acting\/movie. The PQ and AQ were above average, but not demo, with the picture a bit soft in parts. If you're a fan of the genre, give it a rent.","6725":"<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Resident-Evil-Apocalypse-Blu-ray\/dp\/B000EZ7ZZE\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Resident Evil: Apocalypse [Blu-ray<\/a>]MILLA JOVOVICH, MILLA JOVOVICH. NEED I SAY MORE. I THINK NOT.","6727":"Same movie, definite upgrade on visuals and sound.  You have to have the 1080P TV and Dolby Digital capability, otherwise just buy the DVD.","6729":"It's another bad zombie movie. Compared to the majority of thhe others, the only difference here is the main character is a female. The plot is the same. The action scenes are not engaging. Special effects  are so so.","6730":"The pecial effects look exactly like that of a computer game, not real. The action is the top. There's no plot. It's not woth watching.","6739":"Converting video games into movies is a recipe for disaster.  Especially given how overdone the zombie genre is.  I came in to this movie with suitably low expectations.  In return I got a movie with many interesting twists and turns, some social commentary, subtle ironies and a great ending.  At times it was predictable, but there were enough surprises to keep the movie fresh.  Who could imagine looking forward to part 2 and 3 of a video game based trilogy?","6740":"One of the best Action\/Sci-Fi Movies to come out in a long time. There is still hope for the world of sci-fi. The length of the movie is good (personally I wish it could have been a little longer). Just the right amount of gore for the squeamish (could have been more).\nI would recommend this movie to anyone, who are like-minded.","6743":"Those who panned this movie need to watch something else.  I am a devoted fan of the genre and this is right up there with \"Dead Alive\", \"Return of the Living Dead\", \"Cronos\", and \"28 Days Later\".  Add the babe Milla and it tops the list.","6748":"Many of dvd look better than this blue-ray in the same PS3 upscale.  Movie not bad, but picture could had been better.","6753":"This movie is almost perfect in its execution. Sure its still not completely faithful to the game but hey you cant have it all. This movie is so entertaining you will not even notice the time passing. Nemesis is scary and tough. The story is actually very good and entertaining as well. Siena Guillroy is excellent as Jill Valentine and Oded Fehr is a very good Carlos Oliveira. All in all a very entertaining good movie.","6756":"This was a great movie, the book drags on and on, but the characters are spot on!!","6757":"Complicated love themes - romantic, familial, fraternal.  Strong cast. Great story!","6758":"Excellent product quality as advertised.","6759":"Very good movie.","6760":"I loved the book but the movie doesn't do the story justice.  But that would be hard to do in 90 minutes and your book is over 700 pages.","6764":"Its an average blu-ray, but I love the movie itself. I guess I am a Milla fan.","6765":"Action from start to finish and shot mostly in the dark.  DVD looked great with upconverting player, but compared to HD, this looks even better.  Richer colors and so much more detail compared to the dvd release.","6766":"Sony pulled out all the stops to show off the power of Blu-Ray in this movie taking an already great movie with tons of great effects and bringing them to perfect stunning HD quality in both visual and audio.","6768":"The first film was much better than R.E. Apocalypse; more gore, better acting, better presentation overall, and it was done with a lot less money!","6769":"GREAT movie!!","6770":"Excellent movie. replaced my VHS with your DVD. Thank You!","6771":"Great old classic - fun seeing again","6772":"It was nice to give as a gift!","6773":"It's wonderful!!","6781":"Classic, iconic Barbra!","6782":"Both Conrac and Conroy would approve.","6783":"One of all time favorite movie.","6784":"The person who received this as a gift was very happy with it.","6785":"Excellent.","6788":"People are mad because it has nothing to do with the game but they have to get over it! It was a fun movie to watch.....why do we have to analyze every part of every movie we see. This movie was entertaining and thats all that matters. Cant wait till #3.","6789":"This movie was shot on a low budjet (i think amazons is wrong) and it came out unbelievable! People criticize the movie because it is different from the games but they have to calm down! The movie was made with aspects of the game in it but was intended to be different.....think of it as a side story. but really the movie was great.","6793":"thought its ok slipt in the middle about it, it had its moment of good scenes but i have seen worst when they are doing sequels","6794":"After just reading the book the movie was quite a disappointment.  Of course a movie cannot have the detail of the book, but a lot of the highlights I thought were overlooked.  It lacked telling the love the people had for their land and the sacrifice for it.  The movie was mostly just a love story, and there are so many of those that are just monotony rehashed.","6795":"good movie","6796":"Story about adultery with lots of violence as well as sex.","6797":"My 4th time watching it.","6798":"This movie is a classic.  Great cast . . . great story . . . beautifully shot.  Even though it isn't a current film,  the story of family relationships holds true.","6799":"Great","6800":"I had to watch it for my Grad Psychology class this time.  As a M.H. counselor you see the dynamics of dysfunction interplaying. Now I want to go read the book.  This movie isn't about a romance, it is so much more.","6801":"Thanks","6802":"I don't like films about a man being unfaithful","6803":"Revisited this movie after reading the book and was very happy with how well it followed","6811":"The movie was completely awesome! I just can't wait for part 3!","6813":"A classic love story.  Very well written as a book and wonderfully crafted as a movie.","6814":"Read this decades ago when it first came out, then saw the homage to herself that Streisand directed. Found it in a buy-one-get-two-free bin at my local library. Had forgotten how wonderful this is. Worth a second read. The other two books were Mildred Pierce  and One Flew Over The Cookoo's Nest. I should have bought a lottery ticket. It was my lucky day!","6815":"If you have wounds that still need healing from your childhood, this one won't let you down. VERY well written; well directed with great acting!","6816":"Enjoyed this picture very much. Streisand and Nolte were wonderful together! Great chemistry! Remember Barbra does not sing in this one!","6817":"One of my favorite all time movies. Not as good as the book but still impressive.\nSouthern Gothic at its finest.","6818":"Outstanding performance by Nick Nolte. He should have won an Oscar. More deserving than any thing done in Silence of the Lambs. Great job by Streisand as well.","6823":"I give this 4.5 Stars out of 5 not 4 or not 5 4.5\n\nThis game had more relation to the game which made me enjoy it that much more\n\nJill Valentine oooooo yessss\n\nNemesis creature\n\nNikali\n\nCarlos  etc.\n\nmovie was great but\n\nThis super women character can get a little annoying and off topic thats why i give it 4.5 stars","6824":"I have played all of the RE games and this movie was better than expected the story line was decent the acting was good and the effects where nice\n\nHowever there is not much to relate to the game thats my reason for 4 rather than5","6828":"Since Pat Conroy died, I want to read all his novels and see all his films made from his novel.","6829":"We loved this movie. I have read all of Pat Conroy's terrific books except Prince of Tides but was thrilled to watch this movie which was excellent. Even though it is over 20 years old it was as good as it gets.  Sure beats a lot of movies made these days.","6830":"Wonderful romantic movie.","6831":"This movie was great! there were parts in the movie that scared the heck out of me!  loved the evil dogs, zombie movies are some of my favorite in the horror\/sci fi genre.  It was great seeing a new take on the Zombie storyline.  Unlike \"Dawn On The Dead\", we were actually given a reason as to why this was happening, and why people were coming back to life.\n\nThe Red Queen was creepy, but then again little kids in these kinds of movies are usually creepy to me anyway.\n\nLoved the action! loved scares!","6832":"Best movie ever! resident evil is great, this movie really brang it all alive. From the Setting to the DEAD! it was awsome, you must see this!","6840":"Loved the plot and all actors, but I got tired of the phoney Southern accent.","6841":"A very good movie","6842":"Nick was very good...got that Southern accent without making fun of it ( I am a Southerner and hated bad movie Southern accents in the 50's.  Movie shows resurrection and faithfulness renewed.","6843":"An epic movie: lush, evocative, beautiful, full, and kind.","6844":"It's heavy-handed, especially the music, but it's attuned to the spirit of the book more than you'd expect.","6845":"A haunting and many layered tale of love and dysfunction - and overcoming mental and physical abuse to salvage one's adult sanity and relationships.","6846":"A chic flick which does not pretend to be anything else. But, despite the presence of Streisand it is Ok for what it tries to do with the Conroy story.","6847":"Awesome movie that should be watched by everyone!! Love the therapy angle that shows how important 'family dynamics' are to EVERYONE; not just the ones who are 'obviously troubled' (the sister), but the ones who put on the 'bravado', while living a seemingly 'normal, functioning life, and deep down are in extreme emotional pain. Highly recommend this movie!!","6850":"i loved this movie way better than the dawn of the dead lots of action and tons of good special effects this movie is a must have for any zombie fan","6856":"An older movie I had never seen. I will tell you this will stick w me for a lifetime.","6857":"A very good movie.  I am a big fan of Barbara Streisand.","6862":"I saw this when it first came out and I was blown away. The zombies in this film look awesome. Though no characters from the game appear the characters in this film are very strong and so are the actors who play them. The licker in this film is so intense looking, just like in the game. Milla Jovovich and Michelle Rodriguez are great as the two female leads. My favorite scene is the dog scene. From the director of Event Horizon, Mortal Kombat, and Alien vs. Predator. Highly Recommended.","6864":"Caught this again last night on TCM. Haven't seen it for at least 15 years. It's as good as it was when it first came out. Superlative acting , story, and direction. The final two scenes always make me teary eyed.","6865":"Beautifully filmed but otherwise, a vanity piece for producer Streisand who loves the camera to love her and blonde love interests--Nolte, Redford, Bridges.  Best Nolte ever looked and good performances from Kate Nelligan and Blythe Daner but otherwise, offputting by profanity and focus on Streisand.","6866":"Great movie","6867":"I have seen this movie more than 10 times. I read the book in college and this is one of few movies that is as good or better than the novel. Streisand is classy and sophisticated yet vulnerable. Nolte is jovial yet complicated. This movie is a classic for those interested in psychology. I also appreciate the contrast of the South and North. Having lived in both I can relate to the paradoxes between the two. Finally, the ending is realistic and not some Hollywood fantasy.","6868":"What a great and timeless movie.  Nick Nolte is spectacular!","6869":"Just what I expected.","6870":"Great movie.","6871":"Great merchandise.  Shipped promptly","6872":"Disgusting because of a scene where the mom, a little girl and boy get raped. It is very graphic. Burn this movie.","6878":"Being a huge fan of the games and a huge horror fan, i was excited when i heard about this. But that soon vanished after seeing the movie. Poor special effects and CG, coupled with characters i didn't give a crap about wasn't much insentive to watch to the end but i gave it a go. It didn't really get much better. A few good scenes and the original Licker were ok, but all in all it's not one to rush out and buy right away. And if you are gonna get it, don't expect too much. Enjoy!","6879":"Love it!","6886":"This movie is more base on the video then the first movie was. I have to say the action is better on the second. The woman name Alice doesn't feel or function like a human. She jumps high dodging the missle shot by the mutanted nemesis. In the end Raccoon City was distroyed in the end in reality theirs no such thing, they shot the movie in Canada. Theirs not much blood in the movie compaired to the first movie and mutant lickers don't look as scary this time. That's why only four stars.","6888":"I saw this movie a long time ago.  I wanted to see it again.  It really is a great story and well acted.","6889":"good product","6890":"As you can see, I just enjoy Barbra Streisand CD's and DVD's.  This is an amazing movie.  Content is very intense.\nStill she is an amazing actress whatever part she plays in her movies.  Nick Nolte is amazing in this one as well.","6892":"I read the book after the movie. Loved them both.","6893":"Movie was great.","6894":"Loved this movie","6895":"It was pretty good but I don't care for Barbara, but like Nick Nolte, not one of the movies we've watched more that a time or two.","6900":"With the success of the original movie, Resident Evil.  I find myself seeing the sequel to it, Resident Evil: Apolcalypse.  With low expectations I found that this movie was silly, filled with action, and didn't have much character development nor a very good atmosphere that usually makes up a great film.  With that said, the movie was still good enough to be enjoyed as an entertaining movie.  With another solid acting job as the hero, Milla has convinced me that she belongs as a bad-ass super-hero.","6902":"resident evil apocalypse in my opion was way better than the first movie more action more zombie action and more characters from from the games are in the movie i really hope their will be a resident evil 3 movie and the future","6906":"I've watched this movie at least ten times, and I cry every time! It's one of my top ten movies!","6907":"ok","6908":"I think I have seen this film several times. Love anything Pat Conroy!","6909":"good movie but it keeps stopping towards the end don't no why","6910":"This movie get me in the heart every time.  It has such heartbreak and such sadness, but it also has such hope as well as vindication.  Two stellar actors and a story that is many a persons life in parallel.  A must watch movie.","6914":"This movie got straight to the action before any plot even started which made the movie even better. Most people judge this movie by saying it's stupid and not having any point,but people who love to have fun with action films,this is for you. It's fun,\n\nscary,and gets you going,and it doesn't have stupid love stories in it.","6920":"wonderful dvd","6921":"Great cinema.  A miraculous story (I read the book, which is a marvel!!) told most poignantly and insightfully.  Not to be missed!","6923":"What a movie!  It will send you to soaring heights of emotion, and then plunge you into the darkness of the mental illness that is in Pat Conroy's characters.  It is a roller coaster, so hang on, it will make you FEEL.","6924":"A movie I have always loved and will continue to watch again and again.","6925":"Brilliant family struggle w\/ adversity as a tough Coach faces himself and learns from his therapist, Barbra Streisand who gives him love.  Very high quality script by top actors of our generation.","6926":"A replacement for a tape I used to have. As a child victim it does me good to see someone heal. My husband hated it for a different reason. It brought back bad memories for him. I guess it is all how you look at it.","6927":"This is great.;  I enjoyed watching it recently and its great to have a nice DVD of this wonderful movie.","6928":"This movie gets five stars for the score alone (though the performances are spot-on from every actor).  \"Places That Belong To You,\" by Babs should have played over the end credits.  Awesome movie!","6936":"I liked this movie. I'm a big Pat Conroy fan Nick Nolte a former college football player was exactly the way I imagined Pat Conroy would be his accent, his southern charm, athletic good looks. Barbra Streisand had me sold as a Manhattan head shrinker who must fight her way through Pat's defenses to pry out a hidden family secret so she can help Pat's mentally ill sister recover from a nervous breakdown.  An excellent movie about family, about love.","6937":"I enjoyed watching this movie with a clear picture and good audio. I'm glad i purchased it so i can watch it again at another time.\nOne of my all time favorites.","6938":"I really like this movie, it makes touches me .  The DVD was recently purchased to replace the VHS copy I had...","6939":"The Prince of Tides is an interesting movie. The cover picture does not convey the correct picture of what the movie is about. Frankly, the love affair between those two is a small part of the film. The film is more about Nick Nolte character's memories of his childhood, considering that Barbara's character is trying to figure out why Nolte's character twin sister is suicidal. In fact, Nolte's character is so affected by his own childhood that he needs to find his way; in the end he does.","6940":"This film surprised me. I think great acting and a great story and of course the visuals in this film all make it excellent, too.","6941":"The movie was okay, but not my favorite.  Both are super actors, but it was not my kind of movie.","6942":"I bought this movie for my mom because she loves this movie and also loves the book.  She has really enjoyed watching it over and over again.","6946":"Resident Evil 2 was quite a good seqeul. It had enough action in it to keep me satisfied. The story although quite lacked in originality and was quite flat at times. But the movie did have some good scares and had way more action than the first movie.\n\nPros: More Action Than The First, Scary, Suspensful, Enjoyable Cast, Watchable.\n\nCons: Unoriginal, Flat At Times.\n\nOverall: 2 1\/2 stars","6952":"We all should have an open mind about ourselves & others. We never know what our friends are going through just because they have a smile on their face. This movie opens up Pandora's box for just about each one in the movie. I thought it was well played, good dialog and well accepted. It makes you think, and enjoy life a little more. Take a look at yourself & laugh.","6953":"It is countless how many times I have seen this movie.  There is one rough scene with the children, but other than that, it is a wonderful movie and one of her best.  Will she ever be recognized as one of the best directors?","6954":"I have watched this movie a couple times , as well read the book. It is based on true story and well described. It shows the reality that boys too can be raped.","6955":"Nolte at his finest...Streisand should have won \"Best Director\" for this movie...normally not into 'chick flicks' but this was to me more than that...it had a story...with a great title!","6956":"If you have never seen the movie , you are going to be in shock as to the sensivity that the movie embraces.  This is a movie that everyone should see.","6957":"This is the place to go to buy your favorite older movies when you're still switching out from VHS to DVD. A great movie at a great price delivered right to your door!","6958":"This movie is Streisand's best, and ditto for Nick Nolte. It's the story of Tom Wingo. It is the story of passion and love and hate and fear and redemption. Based on Pat Conroy's brilliant novel it is mesmerizing and touches the heart in a way that no other movie has quite managed to do.","6959":"The quality of this movie was great.  I really enjoyed Streisand and Nolte as the stars in this film and  it is definitely a deep movie. So prepared to be touched.  Thanks, Samantastar","6967":"Loved the way it was written and the acting was excellent. Highly recommend it to people who love a serious story.","6968":"I love this movie and if you are a Barbra Streisand fan it is worth buying...It is a movie I enjoy watching over and over again.","6969":"Still great after all these years!!!  Love the South Carolina lowcountry.  Beautiful country - beautiful people.  This story brought me back to some great memories!!!","6970":"so I ordered it. I had read the book and have seen the movie when originally released. It was a nice rainy afternoon movie and I was glad to experience it again. It certainly provides an example of how unaddressed violence and violation can create wounds that can haunt victims until they find a voice to speak about what happened.","6971":"great movie it was fun'exciting'action pack'great story'this movie was hot and sexy.i heard they are making a squel to it called Resident Evil Afterlife i found abouth it on the web. but inny way see it you will love it.you will not be left down","6976":"The first movie was very good although it did not have the same impact as the game did. This sequal however was the worst piece of storytelling I have seen on screen.\n\nDon't waste your money...","6980":"Barbara and Nick did a great job on this! The story told what can happen when secrets are kept. Great","6981":"Solid script and directing, great acting, good story, and exceptionally lovely photography. I confess to being a fan of Streisand and Nolte. Get the wide screen edition and enjoy.","6982":"The item arrived very quickly. I got it for my grandmother- it is one of her favorite movies. The disk played without skipping.","6983":"One of my favorite movies.  I've watched it on TV many times, and decided I should just buy it!  Nick Nolte was the perfect choice for the lead, and Barbra Streisand is a very good actress.  For mature adults - even guys.","6984":"Happy with it more because it's a good movie, nothing I really paid for.\n\nVery emotional film, but very good.","6985":"Amazing movie; I think that Nick Nolte is at his best in this movie.  Wish there could be a sequel.","6986":"I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing.  They are all good movies and received in great condition.  They make a good addition to my collection.  Thank you for very good service.","6987":"GREAT MOVIE! GREAT TAKE ON THE BOOK! BUY IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!! YOU WISH IT WOULD'NT END THATS HOW GREAT A MOVIE IT IS!!!","6991":"This movie isn't as bad as they say, has intrigue and mystery, an of course the gorgeous Milla Jovovich. The bad part in the movie it's when Milla begins to have flashbacks and the heavy metal music. Or the bad special effects of the lickers. This isn't one of those bad zombie movies made with 4 dollars in the pocket, you never know what will happen around corner. And the movie ends with a surprise nobody expects, shocking.","6992":"i loved this movie soo much when i 1st saw it, i bought it 2days b4 it was uspposed 2 comoe out and everythingits alot scarier then the original movie was and theres so much more action n nemesis is s pimp and a half. i don't get people dawn of the dead is ust zombies and thats it no story line just zombnies chasing people. this atleast has a awesome story line and awesome special effects. i recommend this movie","6993":"This movie is (like the title of this review) totally awesome. This one has a lot more action and is more suitable to the Resident Evil series. It touches more on the coolest monsters in the Resident Evil series, the Lickers. The ending is awesome. Good thing thier going to a third one cause I can't wait.\n\nP.S. - Does anyone else but me think that Milla Jovovich is a little flat chested?","6994":"Story begins with the suicide attempt of a sister and the brother must work with her therapist to unravel the mystery of her dark emotional past.  Without spoiling the ending, I must say there were many flashbacks in this movie to help the viewer discover the dark secret.  Unrealistic is the romantic adventure between the brother and the therapist, but hey, the movie would be bland without a little bedroom scene.","6995":"I just finished the book and then watched the movie. The book is fantastic and so was the movie in its own way. Pat Conroy helped write the script and I am sure approved the changes. Captures a lot of the feeling of the book.","6996":"This is quite the love story.  Filled with hope and tradgedy.  Simply stunning in its entirety.  My favorite movie to date.","6997":"The Prince of Tides movie arrived on time with no damage. Even though it's an older movie, It's still a great movie. I feel it's worth adding to any movie collection.","7013":"Item arrived before expected delivery date and in condition promised.  Would definitely recommend this seller!","7018":"The Prince of Tides starring and directed by Barbra Streisand is a moving story. Nick Nolte is perfection in this film, I love the character development and layout. This movie is so sad and draining but the end results was totally worth it, you've got to see this one! Enjoy.","7019":"I think this movie is Streisand's masterpiece.  It is very good and the story is very well developed.  The acting from all parties is terrific and the direction by Streisand is wonderful.  I saw this film when it first came out and enjoyed it very much.  I know that many people who read the book were not happy but I think she pared down the book to a very manageable size.  I highly recommend it.","7029":"Barbara strived to be someone as she was growing up in Flatbush. She was always told that she couldn't do this, wouldn't be this, and with that nose........\nBarbara gives a performance of dignity and determination. Her personal belief and life's experiences are interwoven in this production.\n\nThe Price of Tides.......it will make you proud and give you hope.","7030":"I have seen this film a number of times, realized I wanted a copy to keep. While Pat Conroy's books are too often \"over-written,\" including PRINCE OF TIDES -- I still love this particular book, and the script for the film -- brava to Streisand. And Nick Nolte is marvelous!","7033":"This movie should get more credit than it's getting.  I thought it was better than the first in many ways.  It's a solid action flick.  So what if they deviated from the video game a bit.  There were a lot of references for fans to pick up on.  Good entertainment.","7036":"This is very similar to the George Romero Dawn of the Dead Movies with similar zombies trying to eat the living.  This was caused by an experiment gown awry.  The group of people in this one are in a cordoned off city looking for the daughter of the scientist who caused the mess.\n\nThe female action hero is excellent (reminicent of Gena Davis in The Long Kiss Goodnight) and the action is well choreographed.","7038":"Sensible and poignant melodrama about an alcoholic. With a sumptuous reference frame, Streisand made possibly her finest masterpiece.\n\nPenetrating script with a towering acting of Nick Nolte.","7039":"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE THE EARLY 90S AND WAS AMAZED AT WHAT A WONDERFUL PICTURE IT IS.  THE FILM WAS NOMINATED FOR BEST PICTURE, BEST ACTOR FOR NICK NOTLE AND BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS FOR KATE NELIGAN - UNFORTUNATELY, MISS STRIESAND WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR BEST DIRECTOR, WHICH SURELY IS A MISFORTUNE BECAUSE IT WAS SHE WHO COAXED THESE MARVELOUS PERFORMANCES FROM THESE ACTORS.  WATCH IT AND LOVE IT.","7040":"This movie starring Barbara Striesand and Nick Nolte is a fantastic movie.  Although long, you never become bored.  You are drawn in from the moment it starts.  I think the story is beautiful and has beautiful scenery.  Anyone from the south knows why they live here.  It's a wonderful place.  Great movie of redemption for Nick Nolte's character and Striesand as his savior.","7042":"Great acting and development in the multi-linear plot movie. Very heavy movie however, that may be out of some people's \"reach\" as to understanding and appreciation. Strisand and Nolte were both brilliant.","7044":"My whole family loves this movie.  The acting and story are so powerful.  I've read the book, and like nearly every adaptation, there are parts that are left out, but the movie is still excellent despite the omissions.\n\nAnyone with a heart will love this movie.  If you are not easily moved by sentiment and poignancy, then you probably won't appreciate it.\n\nIf you like movies such as 'Steel Magnolias', 'The Hours', or 'To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday', then I think you'll love this movie.","7051":"This movie would have been better if they had developed the characters more and stopped trying to cram so much into a relatively short movie.\n\nI do not play the Resident Evil game, but I like movies based on games.  It feels like this movie was created by a committee of game players with ADD.\n\nMilla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are hot.  The costumes, weapons, action sequences, etc...are very well done.  Overall, it's a good movie that could have been so much better.","7070":"This movie is quite gastly when compaired to the first resident evil,I mean this movie hade a cheese factor of 8 out of 10 it is quite obvious that there was a differant director who made the movie. if you like the games then stick to the first movie it's much better and so is the video transfer, for some reason they gave this movie a really bad transfer, none of the blacks are black and the color is washed out I was fooling around with my color and brightness controls throughout the whole movie.","7073":"It's a zombie movie based on a popular video game, so I didn't expect much.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A bit of mystery, characters with personality and -- of course -- the zombies all came together to make a good film.  Science fiction and horror fans are right to love it.","7076":"Ok, what horror movie has a good script??? This is one of the \"good\" horror game-based movies I've seen, yet this falls short on revealing game antics. For those that have fans of the game for more than 6 years, will be dissapointed, yet will respect it for being Resident Evil, itself. The game series is \"perfect\" compared to the movie. This fairly deserves a 3.8\/5. Recommended for any Resident Evil fan.","7079":"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to I think the end or was it the beginning.  This film was terrific and I loved it except the end was not really the end, instead it positioned itself as chapeter two of ?? don't know how many more, but I hope it will be released soon. Don't like paying for a whole movie and finding out it is not the whole one. The Movie was done well, and lots of the same and more from the fist flick.  Yep, it is worth buying.","7082":"All the action in this movie is insane. It's awesome when The Militiant Group is kicking the zombies' asses. Milla Jovovich is one tough cookie against the zombies and knows all their weaknesses and Michelle Rodriguez did a great job playing her part even though the role was not as big as it should have been. This movie is a great way to be entertained for a couple of hours!","7083":"I am an enormous Milla fan and I thought Resident Evil 2 was good. Although I do prefer the first film. The whole thing about accuracy compared to the actual video game is of little or no importance to me. I am more interested in the quality of the film judged on its own merit. If you like the game, action filled zombie movies or the divine Milla Jovovich, you should check out this DVD. But also take a look at part one, if you haven't already.","7088":"Lets just pretend there is no such thing as the first movie, and this is the only one.  This movie had everything, even a little cheesy-ness now and then (not a good thing.) This is the reason why this is 4 stars, not 5.  The zombies were great, Nemesis was great, the lickers made A HUGE improvement from the first (wait, there is no first, remember) and the charcters were all great in their own way.  Check this movie out, the only thing missing is Arnold.","7092":"they will be releasing RE2 by itself as well with different cover art of the girl alice holding two swords or knifes whichever. should be great i know im getting my copy","7105":"NOW THAT'S A REAL RESIDENT EVIL MOVIE AND THIS TIME IT'S JUST LIKE THE GAME EVEN BETTER","7111":"I just saw this movie the other day.  This movie is DA BOMB!  Why better then the first one.  I really loved the action, there was also some parts of the film that where really funny.  I don't remember his screen name, he also played in two of the \"Friday\" movies.  He was funny as HECK.","7119":"This one is pretty good compared to the first movie.  This is not a great movie but it is watchable.  This time around it captures the atmosphere of the game much much better. Go see it. You may like it.","7121":"Okay it has bad dialogue and many flaws, but If you like the games then you will love how thism ovie was made! Zombies, lickers, and Nemesis!!!!STARSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","7129":"I am disappointed that they took so long to make a sequel, but i was not disappointed.  Since i don't wanna spoil it for you ill just say it was great, maybe as good as the first one, which i am currently reviewing.  Anyways when availabel on DVD, make sure you buy them both.","7131":"Geez, what can I say!?!? I just saw this movie tonight and it was just so awesome. Now hopefully people will quit b*tching that the movie's not like the game.\n\nI thought that the acting was done really well; the storyline was great; there was a lot more action and stuff happening; better, greater special effects .... Just all around good!\n\nThis one SERIOUSLY has a lot of \"make-you-suddenly-jump-out-of-your-seat moments.\" This movie was just well done! A big step up from the first!\n\nLet's hope for a third!","7132":"Here's another awesome movie that the worthess critics will trash,just like every other movie of 2004. Just go see it! Don't listen to any bad reviews! \"Movie critic\" is the most worthess & pointless job ever created! I'd like to see them do better!","7136":"Another movie based on a horror video game francise.  Skip it and save your money unless you are a 13 year old gamer.","7139":"Okay, this movie wasn't the best, but like other sequels released this summer (i.e. Alien vs. Predator, Anacondas 2, etc.) this one was better than the original. The acting was given a much better tweaking, the monsters were maybe a little scary this time, and though the story still stank the action wasn't that bad. I'd give Resident Evil 1 a * 1\/2 star rating, Resident Evil 2 earned a ** in my book. Not good, but better.","7142":"Love the movie but hard to watch in some parts.","7144":"Gratuitous immoral values... also a huge insult to Joan of Arc","7145":"In New York City our movie theatres cost $10.50 not $7.50. The free movie ticket isn't entirely free. Great film and great deluxe edition. Can't wait for the sequel.","7148":"This movie was watchable, surpringly gory, and kept me entertained throughout. However, it is definitely not anything you haven't seen before and isn't too spectacular.\n\nAnd the second movie, coming soon, looks like it could be 100x better...","7151":"A good leadership tool when teaching soft skills to folks in business and industry","7152":"Excellent","7153":"this may have been a good movie without Milla Jovovic she is terrible. she plays Joan as a unstable or off her medication type person. Sorry I could not wait for the execution scene,","7154":"great job even an older movie,have not opened yet","7155":"RELIABLE","7156":"It is a very bad movie about Joan of Arc.  Most of it is fiction.","7157":"I loved the actors but the theme is very bent and twisted. At the end of the movie it makes it look like Joan was basically a lunatic who was actually receiving visions and revelations from Satan the whole time. Very twisted and uninspiring!","7161":"horrible! extremely violent, foul language, Joan was made to look like a nut case . . . horrible production!","7163":"I've always liked this version of Joan of Arc. Milla Jovavich is quite good as the Saint.","7164":"Have watched this SO many times. Actually didn't watch when I rented it. Movies to me have a degree of artistic licence. Luc Besson is most incredible. Viva la France! NOT FOR THE KIDS OR ANYONE THAT ABHORS VIOLENCE.","7165":"Incredibly powerful film, interesting script, fascinating look into the mind of one of the most heroic people in human history.","7167":"Fast repsonse good quality movie AA++","7168":"Wonderful historical fiction about Joan of Arc.  Interesting and exciting.","7169":"Love the historical value","7170":"love it this is alltime fav y'all","7178":"Tough story and pretty graphic, but I still love it","7179":"Awful movie.  Incoherent.","7180":"They made her seem a bit scattered.","7181":"This review does not belong to you..... it belongs to GOD.\n  -- Jean of Arc","7182":"Overlong, but excellent performances from Milla Jovovich and Dustin Hoffman. Nice rental for a Saturday night.","7183":"Oh Mila......if only you could act, even just a little.....what a waste of time watching this crap.  And Dustin Hoffman......you are now dead to me, Sir.","7190":"Replacing all VHS tapes with DVD's. The Messenger is a very good production of the story of Joan of Arc.","7191":"awesome","7192":"if u like action pack movies this is one .","7193":"brilliant","7194":"Needed for class to write a report.","7195":"quick shipper , highly recommend","7196":"THIS MOVIE IS TRULY AMAZING.  YOU WILL BE CAPTIVATED.  I HAVE IT IN MY COLLECTION AND WILL WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN.  FANTASTIC MOVIE FOR THE FAMILY.","7197":"good","7198":"great movie, fast delivery","7199":"Brilliant retelling of the Joan of Arc Story","7200":"Excellent","7201":"very pleased !","7202":"Just as expected, delivered as promises.","7204":"Hopefully this one will be better. Jill will be in it...to be honest i don't like the actress that will play Jill. Jill is one great beautiful character, they should have picked someone else. When we heard that Milla would be the star of Resident Evil we thought she`d be Jill. OK...but Nemesis will be in it and that makes up for anything that went wrong in the first one. I hope the soundtrack to be AWESOME!!!. The zombies were not convincing in the first one, they have to look scarier this time","7207":"BEFORE THIS MOVIE CAME OUT I HAD HIGHLY ANTICIPATED TO BE A GREAT MOVIE, BUT IT SUCKED SO BAD AND IT WAS STUPID THE GRAPHICS WERE HORRIBLE IVE SEEN SCARY MOVIES FROM THE 70'S THAT HAS BETTER SPECIAL EFFECTS THAN THIS CRAP. A LITTLE ADVICE TO ANYONE WHOS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS MOVIE DONT!!!!!! NOT EVEN RENT IT, ITS NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.","7209":"A","7211":"...while wearing chain mail and swinging a longsword. So hot.\n\nOh btw, she dies in the end. But you knew that, right? Paid attention in English history class, right? Of course you did.","7212":"I finally got this movie on DVD after many years of neglecting to buy i9t on DVD. This movie is awesome. Great acting with some humor.","7213":"THIS DVD WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE FOREVER WANTED.I LOVE THE MOVIE SO MUCH.I THINK THE ACTORS CHOOSEN FOR THIS MOVIE ARE GREAT.THE MOVIE CAME IN FAST,NEW AND PACKED GREAT.","7214":"I see a lot of negative reviews due to inaccuracy. Sometimes that's not that important. We watch movies for entertainment.","7215":"Many reviewers say this movie doesn't follow the known story and facts of Joan of Arc, but it's enjoyable and gives a good overall picture of her story.","7217":"I highly recommend the vendor and product.  The DVD arrived well before I thought it would and in excellent condition.  I truly enjoy the actors and cinematography.  I really do think you will too.","7218":"Terrible movie, full of anachronisms; particularly in the dialogue.  While the sets were OK, the writing and acting was just plain bad.  I was expecting more, as John Malchevish and Dustin Hoffman were billed.  Mr. Hoffmans perfomance was really the only redeeming value to the film;  It just wasn't worth the time investment to see it.","7219":"OK!......PERsanly i didn't like the re movie that much....BUT!.....im gonna watch the second one!....especially how nemisis is gonna be in it....and jill.  And Im gettin all excited about it......to bad its not september yet. (sigh)..STTAAAAARRRSS.","7220":"This was a very good\/well made movie. I am a BIG fan of the RE games, but i was a bit dissapointed that they mess with the story a bit, like Alice, all the commandos, the \"hive\", and the \"Red Queen\". The laser part was....ok i did like the beginning and the ending!!! it was one of the best movie endings! you just know there is going to be a RE2! I think this was a great game turned movie, and would recommend it to any horror fans!","7222":"Starts off pretty good but then gets a bit strange when the walking dead arrive and other mutants arrive.","7223":"Captures her struggles and triumphs well. At the end you get the message. She is a mentally ill woman being completely raked over the coals and taken advantage of by the system. She eventually succumbs to a hideous fate.","7225":"I loved this movie. The actress did a fantastic job depicting Joan of Arc. I will definitely see it again and again.","7226":"Excellent and amazing product I recommended for every one because its a very interesting and useful product so buy it now!","7231":"A decent translation of the Playstation game onto the silver screen.  Good acting, good special effects, and compelling story move this film along.\nRecommended.","7236":"it doesnt do good with its wooden dialogue and its crappy acting. basically some moments are way better then others but the blending with zombies and heavy rock isn't great. the suspenseful piano music in the game is better and the games themselves are way better. Anderson directed a ok but boring movie to a great and horrific video game. a dissapointment really","7244":"Full of inaccuracies and anachronisms, \"Joan\" looks like she has been doing aerobics for years and has a Hollywood stylist as well.  Avoid!","7254":"I had to stop after 15 min when the gum chewing mediaeval girls started saying \"YO! DUDE! FER SHURE~! DIG IT!\nbeing somewhat facetious but thats how it was","7260":"I like the action in this movie and all the cast. Too bad things have not changed, just better weapons & more Religion.  Blu-ray is the best way to own any movie, best picture and sound.","7261":"Cinematography fantastic. Sound design fantastic. BD's A\/V quality fantastic. Hop on board and have some fun. Besson style. Great effects, bloody battles, fiery drama as well lush location spots. This movie confounded pundits when it came out. Still does. Doesn't anybody try anything different anymore? Look! Low price advantage.","7268":"Interesting movie - pretty good action and story.","7269":"I never played the video game but I still enjoyed this feature.  If you are averse to heavy doses of blood (dogs with skin gone - you get the picture), this is not for you.  I enjoyed the story and it was quite a thrill ride.  In this day and age of corporate greed and coruption, the story fit in nicely.  We don't want those corporations getting out of control, do we?  Last warning - like Blade and Blade II - lots of gore.","7270":"This movie is actually realy good. I am not a fan of the game at all, and despise almost all game=>movie conversions (and movie=>game conversions), but with some arm twisting I was convinced to watch it, and it kicked ass. The movie is actually pretty scary, and I don't scare easily. It sucks you in and leaves twisted images in your head after watching it. Definately at least a rental.","7272":"The game is way better and there are too many spoofs like the writing in the the beginning \"TODAY ALL YOU'RE DREAMS COME TRUE\" they were both different and that was noticeable to me. The speacial effects were great and so was the action and acting. The way they made the ending it means that there has to be a sequel and I hope that they make it a little better than the first. That is all...Good bye.","7276":"There are many filmakers who have eagerly taken on the telling of the tale of Joan of Arc. I am not only impressed with the performance of model\/actress\/singer Milla Jovovich, but I was entranced by the strong force behind the goal of Joan in this version. Sticking with her troops when the chips where down, she is portrayed as a devoted woman full of motivation. Whether or not her story is true, it can inspire anyone who hopes to push their ambition past obstacles.","7284":"This review may sound pretentious and ignorant, but in truth I'm a big fan of British history, so bear with me!\n\nEven as a film itself, it's surreal, and I don't like the acting. But as with any historical film that includes the British, they're made out to be the absolute bad guys! Sure we were forging an empire within France (i.e. The Hundred Years War), but rapists and murdering pillagers!? Never!\n\nHistorically accurate, full of British sentiment, and down-right weird. Avoid this film today, folks!","7287":"First off 4 stars for the movie, and throw in the 5th for it being in super bit!!  I love the super bit concept!  The movie with highest bit rate possible for the best picture!  Screw multible languages, and boring makeing of featurets, and DTS sound, Ionly need either DTS or Dolby Digital not both.  Anyway good Zombie flick from a game, looks and sounds fantastic...","7288":"I guess you might have to be a fan of the game in order to enjoy the movie.  But I doubt that even if that were true that one could derive any enjoyment out of this piece of trash.  There is one moment of pleasure, for all you gore fans, but that is the extent.  I hated almost every moment of it.  It is not that the story so much is awful, it is the execution.  And, the acting is not all that good either.  Don't waste your time on this one.","7290":"I thought Paul Anderson has done a really good job at directing this movie, and 2 of the cast members doing a funny audio commentary with one of the director's producing buddies.  I'd give this movie 4 stars, because I've been a fan of video game based movies, after seeing Super Mario Brothers in 93' and Paul Anderson's \"Mortal Kombat\" in 95'.  I would have given this 5 stars, if the movie wasn't too short and extended by 10-20 minutes.  But I definitly gotta catch the sequel whenever it comes out.","7299":"This is not a zombie movie but a warning about bio weaponry mistakes, but it was still good. I maen the way that they kept the stillness from the game in it. They kept the surprises too. The actors did great too. I hope that they make a Resident Evil 2 soon cause it would be great to see.","7302":"if u like loud heavy rock music and this game then ull love this movie!","7307":"A very well made historical film about a very controversial character. Excelent acting.","7311":"Clearly the producers set out to make a mockery of Joan of Arc and they accomplished that goal rather well. While the costumes and the music are rather good, the script and the actors play their roles over-the-top and it makes for a silly sight.\nIt seems that only revered Christians can be so badly depicted in Hollywood. I recommend a pass on this hate-mongering.","7313":"This movie combines aspects from the true story of Joan of Ark into a fighting fest and I love it. The battle scenes are nice and gore with blood coming from every part of those peoples bodys. But, it does try to tie history in it. Joan of Ark is potrayed to be a nice warrior. Millia Jovovich is a great actor. This movie got me very interested in Joan of Ark. This is one of my favorite movies ever!","7315":"I watch a lot of history movies, and I seen many complaints about the accuracy of a book to a movie. Exspecially with this movie. Yes, it was too Hollywood. But without Hollywood a person would not get the deep down war camera views. I totally loved it, and it  basically pretty fair on the true story of Joan of Arc.","7317":"Luc Besson has done some spectacular movies. This is not one of them. Milla's over-acting creates a character who is both annoying and difficult to believe. None of the central characters are easy to empathize with so one doesn't really care if they live or die. The violence seems unnecessary and gruesome. The script is choppy and the dialog is forced. Go watch The Professional instead.","7319":"The woman in this movie was no saint. How can anybody who signs their faith over to save their own neck be a saint? And then she goes and admits that she did everything for her own revenge. Was God in this movie at all??? I doubt it. The devil was in it though and Joan surely goes straight to Hell after she is killed. I was expecting an uplifting movie about a woman of God. Instead I got a movie about some nut.","7321":"This was what I consider the best zombie flick modern man _will_ construct at this point in time.  I LOVE zombie movies!  As sad as it might seem to the \"true believer\" of the genera; the true Zombie Epic for us has yet to be born!  It waits to be conceived!  What does our existence say to the Age?  Will we survive the coming upheaval of the New, or will We, as expected, be consumed by the New?\nRage against the Inevitable!!!","7323":"The movie is ok....that's it.....just ok!!!  It has some scary moments but as a fan of the game....I thought the game was scarier than the movie!! ....","7325":"THIS MOVIE WASNT WAHT I HAD THOUGHT. ITS ALL THE WRONG THING. U THINK THAT THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. IF I WAS U THEN I WOULDNT GO AND SEE IT.","7333":"I did not particularly like the action, and I found the whole movie a bit gloomy, lacking some lustre, some glamour (even though the close-ups on the pupils of Mila Jovovich are interesting). This is partly due to the origin of the movie (a video-game). Apart from that, the story itself is original and interesting (the T-Virus, the Hive, etc.) and there is some suspense. This is probably not the best movie of Mila Jovovich.","7334":"Derivative, boring, and beyond stupid, zombie flick \"Resident Evil\" misses every possible opportunity to scare, thrill, or even make sense. It doesn't even have the gorey guts of its video game inspiration. Your best bet? Skip this soulless claptrap and see how good movies weave complex plots, well-drawn characters, and true scares into a terrifying whole. \"Aliens,\" \"Dawn of the Dead.\" and \"Blade 2\" are an excellent start.","7335":"It was exactly what I expected and even a little more.  Very stylish movie with a lot of fast paced action, and Milla is hot throughout.  It seems that either most people liked it or hated it.  It is a rental for sure, and if you're like me you'll probably buy it.","7356":"I can't wait Untill Resident Evil Nemesis comes out in 2003\/2004! Great Director! I love they way it is based on the RE Series from the Classic PS days! RE 1,2! it is just a even total different type of Horror Movie! Um \"Night Of The Livin Dead!\" Remember that classic movie will its kinda like it so..watch and see if you like it..Don't watch it in the dark!","7358":"I admit there were times wen it put u on edge and lots of suspense and the special effects weren't half bad but were as a lot of ppl probably liked the storyline I didn't really buy into it and I thought it could've been more scary","7362":"this movie was good as a action movie and just as good as a spiritual type of movie. It was sad, touching, and hartwarming. I say this movie is a must see.","7363":"Holy Cow!  Who told model-girl she could act?  I'm sure the casting director who made the call is long out of work by now.  The only redeeming quality of this film is Dustin Hoffman.  Other than that, it's a total joke.  Even John Malkovich made me wretch (and I usually love him). If you're really curious, rent it, or maybe catch it as it flies out of someone's window, or perhaps you'll find a copy at the dump?","7364":"This stinkeroo is getting as much effort from me in this review as director Luc Besson put into his scenario.  Yow!! Luc Besson has made some awful movies, but this one has got to be among the very worst, and is certainly the most blatantly dishonest and ugly.","7368":"Visually dazzling and hypnotically exciting, the Messenger is a movie that never fails to entertain. Staying true to Besson's flamboyant film style, the movie begins so well, that it grabs you and doesn't let go. Its too badit doesn't completely hold out to the end, but Jovovich's wild-eyed performance more than makes up for that fault. Historic film making at its finest.","7374":"I don't like video games to be turned into movies. However, this is a pretty good movie. (Not to mention Mila Naked) It lacked something along the way, and the super creature zombies [were bad]. The dog zombies were the best part of the film, and its worth watching just to see them, and mila naked. Definately worth watching.","7375":"Being a movie based on a videogame I had low expectations but right from the start it grabbed me and kept me glued to the screen. The movie hold a high level of tension and terror right from the opening scenes. It does get somewhat choppy at times but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The vhs video quality is excellent and the audio is top notch with a clear, dynamic and very deep low and upper ends. Overall: VERY GOOD.","7380":"Like Braveheart before it, this film portrays the English as a truly barbaric bunch of pillaging maniacs, which indeed we were before the invention of the cucumber sandwich.","7383":"I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in a movie.  This was historically inaccurate beyond belief.  It almost seemed like it was making Joan out to be the villain.  If you want to see a good movie on Joan Of Arc, see the \"Joan Of Arc\" movie that was on TV.","7386":"I wonder that George A Ramero was not  mentioned more in review. This movie seemed to me to be a modern big budget dawn of the dead in space. It DISTURBED me greatly. Pretty horrible so if you like that sort of thing you are likely to like this. I'm not sure if I liked it or  not but it was interesting and compelling.","7407":"Audio Merits:7\/10;Video Merits:9\/10;Scenario Merits:3\/10;Cinematograhic Merits:5\/10;Musical Merits:5\/10;Overall Artistic Performance:6\/10;DVD Extras:6\/10;Recording Total Quality:5\/10. Professor's Recommendation:Worst  of all Joan of Arc titles. Don't buy it.","7408":"Starts off with great battles, drama, everything you could want!  But after a while, you just want it to end.  Interesting enough to rent.....only to rent.","7415":"The score to this film was flawless but, the movie itself is just another average in my book. Marilyn Manson did the score for this movie and he did  a job! If you watch the commentary to this movie they said that they didn't want to show zombies in the beginning because, you knew that you were gonna see some any way. The film didn't even have enough gore to be a serious zombie movie. I give this 2.5 stars.","7417":"This is what is worthwhile watching in this movie. Nothing more. THe  battle sequences are amazing; it's funny to see all the British with rotten  teeth and the French with white clear and white teeth !! Mila did not a  good job, repeat, did not a god job as Joan. She overacted with no purpose  at all. Dustin Hofffmann, as her conscience, is fantastic, although in a  very small role.","7420":"Great acting by Jovovich and Malkovich.  Unparalleled cinematography and directorship by Besson.  Excellent supporting cast in Dunaway, Hoffman and many others.  The DVD has superior sound and picture quality, and a few extras.  The movie is a bit too long, and the historical facts may be  debatable, but [i]t was not a bad choice for me,  I really enjoyed it.","7429":"I'm not even a big fan of this genre of video game -- or of gorefest flicks -- but a friend convinced me to watch it. The special effects were good overall, and there was plenty of beefcake (especially the now-hunky Eric Mabius) which made it worth watching.\nOverall worth a rental , maybe even a purchase for a repeat guilty pleasure.","7436":"This movie had excellent sets and costume design. The acting is good, the character build up was good for some characters. The fight scenes were almost as good as Braveheart. The script was very modern, with phrases like  booty. The film dragged a little at some points and could have used some  more trimming. The ending was kind of empty in its simplicity. A lot of the  story is based on assumption, so don't expect a history lesson. Worth  renting but I personally wouldn't buy it.","7443":"i can't believe that reviewers found Milla's acting exaggerated! Joan of Arc was going through every kind of turmoil possible i think the least Milla can do is portray that, which she did beautifully. Superb acting, amazing battle scenes and a neutral view, which allows viewers to decide for themselves if Joan was seeking revenge or fulfilling God's message. Go out and buy it! Great work.","7444":"I like this move very much.  I think that war should be shown as the brutal thing that it is and not made to look pretty or glamorous.  But I especially enjoyed the scenes with Dustin Hoffman.  I thought it was a  pretty good depiction of the inner struggle that a spiritual person can go  through.","7453":"A sweeping epic film. I was impressed by the cinematography. I was fascinated by the psychological twists and questions the film raises. The battle scenes, I must say, are not for the fainthearted. This could have  been a great film. What ruined it for me was the performance by Jovovich. I  found it overdone and annoying. I was greatly disappointed.","7456":"The Genera of zombie movies has had many cogs in its wheel.  For example Day of the Dead, Night of the Dead, Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the living dead and so on.  Resident Evil proves that this formula can still work for an audience in the 21st century.  The biggest fault of this movie is what it doesn't use.\nThese include 90% of the cast and its soundtrack.  It is a wonderful B movie and if it's a choice between this and Pearl Harbor rent Resident Evil.  I personally can't wait for the sequel","7458":"Resident Evil was fascinating as a visual, technical piece but overall empty as a movie.  And as a horror movie, there were no thrills, no jumps, no real scares.  I anticipated every zombie, mutant doggie jummping out from corners.  Most of all, I kept wondering why Milla Jovovich, who is such a good actress, deliverd such a flat and emotionaless performance.","7460":"I can't say I'm a huge fan of the hard to play game, but the movie version is AWSOME! Creepy with the perfect mix of gore. Mila Jovovich's preformance was absolutely first rate, with an extra dose of girl power! The movie is true to the style of the video game and the effects are marvelous!","7462":"Having never played the video game, I bought this movie only because of the star, the ever beautiful Milla Jovovich.  I've really enjoyed a lot of her past films.  That said, this movie floored me.  I've seen several, video game to big screen adaptations in the past, most of which were horrible.  This is not the case.  Resident Evil is an absolutely great movie that has some great acting on everybody's parts.  I'f you've not taken the time to watch this movie, correct that.","7463":"I`m one of the fans of the video game {Resident Evil} the game is really scary but with the movie nothing scary here except\nfor some awful acting and lame special effects in fact the video game is a lot more fun than the film.\nAll we hope for is some cool special effects and fight scenes But even on that level, \"Resident Evil\" is a disappointment.\nI do not think being a fan of the game could've possibly improved my enjoyment of this film.","7469":"An awesome action packed on the edge of your seat horror movie with hot chicks.","7471":"I was waiting anxiously for this movie to be released and I am now wondering why.  This was absolutely the worst movie I've seen in years. It is a mish-mosh of totally irrelevant scenarios and I, being a fan of horror for years, lost interest in the first fifteen minutes. If you enjoy the game, do not purchase this film. I have a feeling that we should expect to see Resident Evil 2 on the horizon, due to the ending. Please don't bother.","7476":"the visuals rock. it is very scary. the music is perfect for it. this is possibly the scariest movie ever made. i jumped many times.  it was better than i expected. i think  everyone should watch it plus michelle rodriguez is freaking hott.","7479":"THE R.E. FANS REALLY WANTED TO SEE A FILM THAT LOCKED LIKE THE 3 FRIGHTENING SCARY GAMES ALSO THE BOX COVER LOCKED QUITE STUPID TO ME I HOPE THE SEQUEL WILL BE BETTER","7486":"I love Sinatra and Rita and Kim are right at the top with me but I have to be honest. I was a bit disappointed with this film. It left me rather cold and bored...","7489":"Sinatra at his hipster best. Kim Novak is stunning, Rita dos her dance provacatuer..and the songs are terrific.\nChez Joey is the nightclub that Rita will bankroll only if Joey is \" in line\" Look for Barbara  Nichols in the chorus line.\nJust when you might think the plot drags a  bit here comes another Sinatra standard..and oh that 1957 Thunderbird.!","7492":"Great movie.  Loved it.","7493":"Well, now I know why Sinatra sang The Lady Is A TRAMP!","7494":"GREAT MOVIE AND GREAT SERVICE.","7495":"I enjoyed the music because, I love Frank Sinatra.","7496":"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!","7497":"The best!","7498":"My favorite Sinatra movie w\/a couple of his best songs in it.  Old school & can't help loving Italian skirt-chasers of questionable means named Joey.  Had one myself a few years back.  Kim & Rita are gorgeous...just radiate that back-in-the-day movie star quality.  I know exactly why Mrs. Simpson calls him \"beauty\"...they're like pets you unsure of ever owning.  Doesn't matter that it's romantic mush w\/a predictable story line...it's Sinatra & his ladies in their peak years.","7499":"Loved it!! Classic Sinatra at his best","7505":"Many people said it was a bad movie, but it's far from being bad. Very violent (just as I like). First few minutes lets you confused, but then everything is explained... The story is very cool, the enemies are great too... Zombies look very scary, Cerberus look cool and the Licker had a whole new view, that makes it look very powerful. A must to watch if you like a good entertainment, and a must to own if you're a fan of horror games or horror movies.","7506":"great to see this film available again. What can I say....Frank plus Rogers and Hart. It doesn't get any better.","7507":"The DVD came in before schedule.  The colors and quality great.  Great buy!","7508":"IF YOU LOVE SINATRA , YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE ,","7509":"Classic Sinatra","7510":"Had never seen before. It's an ok musical","7511":"i am a sucker for the old movies","7512":"Movie is good rating on DVD said good but was not, but seller took care of it and return processed fast","7513":"It is classic Sinatra at his best!!!!","7514":"SINATRA AT HIS GREATEST-THIS IS ROLE HE WANTED MOST AND NO ONE-ABSOLUTELY NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER.","7515":"In this updated version of a lover's triangle sees Joey in love with Linda English, a poor struggling singer, as well as Vera, a high-class dame. There are some good numbers and some funny lines as Joey sees a chance to get what he has always wanted: his own joint, a night club with class.\n\nA good movie but not one of Sinatra's best.","7521":"Delivery was fine\nMovie has great music\nThanks\nD","7522":"Love this movie.kim knovak ,mix great and the songs are classic.","7523":"First I picked up the LP at an estate sale. What great songs, and not you typical musical songs. You know, these are Sinatra songs. SO I say hey lets rent the movie and see what this is all about. Turns out the plot is one we'd seen before. But the seeing these actors move around and talk in all that Technicolor! It's a nice movie though, life lessons for young men and young women...and maybe even older women. We loved it.","7524":"CLASSIC GREAT MOVIE!  Everyone should see it...Frank Sinatra is very convincing as a scummy guy, the singing is spectacular--I love every song!  Heard the album as a kid...so this was a real treat for me to see as a \"grown up\".","7525":"Top stars.  Kim Novak is one of the best looking stars of the time","7526":"Fun movie of the times.","7527":"Great movie I hadn't seen in a long time.  Just as good as I remembered.  Nothing better than a Sinatra, Novak and Hayworth movie.","7528":"Frank Sinatra is an ex-lover in my head and this movie plays out our relationship.  This was one of the first movies I watched with Frank Sinatra in it and I fell in love with his acting after that.  I love his music and his movies.  He was one of the greats.","7529":"I watched this movie not knowing what to expect, except Frank Sinatra, whom I love. This was a very entertaining movie. Funny parts, and \"Joey\" can't spell worth spit. It's funny, such as \"money= \"Muny\", and Classy=\"klasy\" :Off=\"orf\".  It's a good movie and worth the watch. It's 1hr and 56min. Frank sings \"The lady is a tramp\" to Rita Hayworth in this. It's good!! And Kim Novik sings \"My funny valentine\"\n\n If you like Sinatra, this is a good one. :)","7530":"Fun movie, but not very deep. Great to see Sinatra at his vocal best. Glad I rented and didn't buy though.","7532":"GREAT MOVIE AND MUSIC","7535":"great","7536":"Good quality, so-so movie.","7537":"It was a gift.  I can't personally say good or bad about it.  My friend  at age 92 thought it was the \"cat's pj's\" ...","7538":"WHAT CAN I SAY....I LIKE A GOOD CHICK FLICK WITH TALENTED SONG WRITERS AND SINGERS (EVEN THOUGH RITA'S IS DUBBED).","7539":"Kim Novack, Rita Hayworth and Frank Sanatra at the Oakland Mole and SP ferry crossing the Bay.","7540":"great","7541":"Good","7542":"Sinatra at the height of his singing and stage prsence.  Rita Hayworth tough, tender, alluring. Kim Novak perfect for the part she played.","7543":"Very happy...  great value...  Thank YOU...  +++++","7544":"Even better than we remembered it. They don't make them like this anymore, actors OR movies.","7545":"GREAT CAST AND WELL DONE","7546":"Loved this movie.  Great, great songs.  Favorite actors are present and in fine form.  A movie-keeper for my collection.  Sinatra at his sharpest.  Kim Novak as delicious as ever.  Rita Hayworth deserving of her fame and reputation as an actress\/dancer\/singer.  I could watch these three forever!  Worth the purchase.","7550":"With the great cast and a cool plot, this could have been a pretty good movie.  However, it just takes all the usual scare tactics to new lows (disappearing bodies, constant gore including a very graphic scene involving lazers, etc.).  There is about one cool scene in the whole thing, not including the beginning and end shots of a very exposed Milla Jovovich.  Well, there's always that upcoming sequel...","7551":"This movie some how follows the plot of the PS game Resident Evil. It talks about how a syndicate turns into zombie and Milla Jovovich has to find out what has happen. It has many scary scenes and most of them got me. Milla is stylish in this movie that has [awesome] fight moves. The special effects are cool as well. Overall, it is an entertaining movie.","7554":"What a cast. Sinatra, Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak. I saw this in theaters when it was first released. I had it on VHS, DVD and now Blu-RAY. It takes place in San Francisco. All three sing in it, Frank, Rita and Kim. I am sure everyone is familiar with the songs. Rita and Kim at their best. Well, so was Frank.","7555":"My headline is a quote from Frank Sinatra who said \"what a great sandwich\" when he was told that Rita had to have top billing so he would be second and Kim Novak third...Terrific movie.  Frank's performance of \"Lady is a Tramp\" has to be the absolute best I have ever heard him do.  Rita does a great  song and dance number as well as a dubbed \"Witchcraft\".  My 20 year old grandson loved this movie..he's learning to appreciate the classic films made before he was born,","7557":"BETWEEN MR SINATRA AND MR MATHIS WHO COULD ASK FOR MORE. THIS IS ONE ENJOYABLE AND MUST SEE MOVIE. ON BLU RAY MAKES IT BETTER IF THATS POSSIBLE","7558":"Great movie, but video quality was poor.  Should have just ordered the dvd","7559":"Now I finally have Annie to my library.","7560":"I love love love this movie!!!\nI can watch it a million times.","7561":"This DVD was for my granddaughter and she watches it frequently","7562":"Great classic movie.","7563":"The picture was not much better then the standard version. The blu ray had more color and more grain then the standard dvd. It was not worth paying the extra amount of money for this Blu Ray. It's just O-K . I believe the company manufacturing this film may have done better work. I hope this helps. Sound was the same on the Blu Ray compared to the standard Dvd. Again not worth paying many times more then the standard dvd.","7564":"This is a fun film with some of the greatest stars of their time.  Rita Hayworth is gorgeous, Frank Sinatra is charming and Kim Novak is refreshing.","7565":"The blu ray transfer is not that great. The colors are faded. What a pitty. They could have made a better job here. The images are too dark. If you wanna see Rita Hayworth in a great and full HD, try Blood and Sand blu ray.","7566":"This movie is a classic! I enjoyed hearing all those wonderful songs . The performances were stellar! I would watch this over & over again.","7567":"a wonderful movie starring 3 legends Rita Hayworth Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak where Frank uses Rita to get him his own nightclub but falls for Kim","7568":"Great entertainment from an age where quality abounded. Fabulous music performed with excellence. A prize movie for my collection. Essential viewing.","7569":"As ever Sinatra acting in his regular ebullient manner  along with the 2 beauties of the era ... Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak  ..\nIn all  classic standard tunes  and from all accounts the best of the Rogers & Hart stageshows .. not much of a story but any aficionados of Sinatra's vocal style will be more than happy with  deliverance of these well known ballads  , in all filming color  consistent and a chestnut well worth having","7570":"great product!","7571":"The acting is meh.  Clearly the stars are portraying their Hollywood personas.  But if you like these stars you won't mind at all.  The story is hokey & predicable but the songs are amazing.  Some of the best songs ever written, IMHO, and well-performed.  Great movie for a rainy afternoon.","7572":"Old movie she could not find and the phone rang once again for a message can you look up \"PAL JOEY\" and that was just what I did.","7573":"Definitely a DVD for your library collection.  All three actors were\ngreat.  Very entertaining and talented stars.  A must buy!","7574":"Hey . . . my title comment says it all. Frank had pretty well developed his persona by this time. What else do you need to say.","7575":"I was four years old when this movie was at the theaters but I distinctly remember the music being played in my home.\n\nSome people thought that this movie was dated but it holds up.  The love triangle is never out of date.\n\nStripper marries well, husband dies, meets new man below her newfound station in society.  Pretty dancer in love with man who is pretty much the boy toy to the newly rich woman.\n\nMy favorite songs in the movie were \"The Lady is a Tramp\" and \"I Didn't Know What Time It Was.\"","7579":"Good movie at a good price.  The extras were enjoyable and perfect for to the point behind the scenes","7580":"Who doesn't love Annie?","7582":"'Pal Joey\" has a terrible plot, a disinterested Sinatra, a gorgeous Rita Hayworth and Kim Novak, never one of my favorites. The music and sound track is the only thing that keeps it above one star. There is no enthusiasm or chemistry of any kind. I am not anti Sinatra. Most of the time he does very well, but not here. This movie is indeed a gasser, but not in a good way. Avoid it.","7583":"Superb Sinatrafication for any Sinatraphile. It just doesn't get any better.... Prime Sinatra with Kim Novak and Rita Hayworth.... The music sounds fantastic on this blu-ray....the video is crisp and colorful and the film is as good as it gets.... Wonderful stuff.... Get it if you can.... Great R and H score worth every cent....","7585":"This movie expects the audience to believe that a really unappealing character like Sinatra's Joey would attract two very reasonable women. It's an old idea that has run its course.\n\nThe movie gets 2 stars for good music.  Nice clothes, too.","7590":"What a great Movie!!  Just what I wanted!  Fast Service.","7591":"CLASSIC! CLASSIC! CLASSIC! AMAZING CAST! AMAZING DIRECTOR! A MUST SEE FOR EVERYONE AT LEAST ONCE OR FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES!","7592":"Fabulous!  Loved every minute.  Great story, great music, Albert Finney is a superstar.","7593":"Kids loved it.","7594":"Pal Joey was filmed in San Francisco and showed off our city nicely. Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak (she is gorgeous)and Rita Hayworth gave outstanding performances to this entertaining musical film.  This was Sinatra's crowning achievement, in my opinion.","7596":"\"Pal Joey\" (1957) makes a sanitized translation to the big screen, with a trio of classic stars - Rita Hayworth, Frank Sinatra and Kim Novak - elevating an uneven, overlong musical. The film is worth seeing for Sinatra's signature tune \"The Lady Is a Tramp\" and director George Sidney's visual stylishness, yet lacks the hard-edged quality of the stage version. Thanks to the prudish Hays Office, \"Pal Joey\" emerges as another casualty of Hollywood censorship.","7601":"Good family movie","7602":"I've loved it!","7603":"It's larger than life and really over produced but you know what, who the hell cares? It's fun, killer songs, The cast is mesmerizing and it's still as fun to watch today as it was years ago.","7604":"GREAT QUALITY & FAST SHIPPING! THANK YOU!","7607":"Of course the movie is fine, that why I ordered it.\nService from Amazon was great as usuall","7609":"This was a so-so story but good music from Sinatra and company.\n\nEspecially nice appearance from Rita Hayworth as the other woman.  She's\n\nstill got the allureshe had as a young actress in musicals in the 40's.\n\nKim Novak is very beautiful and sweet but out of her league against the pros.","7610":"CUTE GREAT MOVIE.","7611":"FAMILY FAVORITE.","7612":"great movie. We watched it with our granddaughters and we all loved it.","7613":"wonderful musical, fun to watch with little girls who haven't seen it yet.  Some beautiful scenes that are classics.","7614":"After such a long time I still enjoy moments watching Annie. Great production. Glad it's available on DVD","7617":"This movie took most of the great songs from the stage play and dumped them.  For a theater lover this is heartbreaking.  What a disappointing story.  If a movie can be faithful to the theater version then this one is a class-A adulterer.  Even the ending was changed and not for the better.  The dubbing for the two leading ladies was also disappointing.  A pretty face is not enough.","7621":"Was there ever a better flim vehicle for Sinatra to stretch out into his swingin' womanizer persona circa late 1950's? Everything about this movie, especially Sinatra himself is a picture perfect portrait of the sophisticated super-club scene born right out of the pages of Playboy magazine. Catch this one for the great location shots of San Francisco, the lovely Kim Novak and Rita Heyworth and of course the peerless score by Rogers and Hart.","7622":"Excellent movie.  I have both movies and I love both of them.","7623":"Great musical.","7624":"Excellent","7625":"Great Movie","7626":"nan","7627":"Love this movie","7628":"Always loved Annie ,the music old cars,and other actors that play in Annie","7630":"Love this movie my kids found it fun","7631":"My daughter loved it.  Even has the actress grown up and giving acting lessons.","7632":"I found it very enjoyable.","7633":"I love musicals & this is a great one!","7634":"this movie was mad...it was really scary and the action didn't stop...the end left you guessing,and it was a great experience....one of the best...buy it!!","7638":"It bothers me to see that almost all adaptions of Video Games to the screen focus entirely on special effects and not on plot.  Unfortunately Resident Evil is not the exception.  The zombie gore and grosseness is all there is to focus on in the film so the viewer is left waiting for the credits to roll.  There is no balance between the plot and the action.  Leaving this film lacking and boring.","7639":"Great","7640":"It is a shame that a kids movie has God d*** used twice and all the sexual references throughout. You can tell how the 1980s really started putting out garbage.  Yes great catchy songs and nice story but we had to fast forward through multiple scenes. If you are a Christian family and want to keep the eyes and ears of your little ones pure, you will want to skip this movie. The Sound of music, Fiddler on the roof, The music man, would all be better alternatives to this one.","7641":"I bought lots of videos for my Grandaughter, as well as her mother ( MY Daughter) they both to this day love ANNIE!! My Granddaughter went 2 weeks ago to see the live Show at a large arena-- and she knew every song-- She loves it!!!","7642":"Great!","7644":"Item as described.","7645":"Good movie.  Carol Bernett is such a talented actress.","7646":"It won't win an Oscar, but who cares.  I totally loved this movie, I can see it over and over, the special effects were cool and the lead actresses, YUMMY!\nBuy this if you want mindless entertainment, if your looking for great cinema-watch the evening news.  The soundtract rocks!!!","7649":"first of all when i saw this movie in theaters it rocked but i would like to say how did final fantasy get all these extra feautures when resident evil was a better movie because i wouldlike to see alternate stuff and a documentary on how they made everything but apart from that i'm still goanna by this because i liked the movie.","7650":"classic and fun","7651":"Classic how can you not enjoy. My daughter loves!","7652":"Love it!","7657":"Lots of fun","7658":"The kids loved this movie.","7659":"Very satisfied with order.","7662":"Nice story of adoption...thru the trials and tribulations..\nMaybe Annie probablee..grew up to be part of  daddy warbucks..business..& empire &\/_or  he may just have let her start a respectable & honorable  business of her own& get merried...be a wife..homemaker..mom...& live happily ever after...","7664":"I believe this is the closest to the original story of Annie.  So enjoyable, especially the music!","7665":"There have been several interpretations of the musical Annie. I purchased this one as I now have two granddaughters that love watching it together. The songs, the music and seeing Carol  Burnett just, for me stealing the show, as is said, was wonderful. I remember in my youth watching the Carol Burnett show, she is a very funny lady.","7666":"The DVD came in good condition.","7667":"This is the best of any Annie's I've seen, and my grand children love it! Never get tired of seeing it!","7676":"One of my kid's favorite movies.  Aileen Quinn was a great \"Annie\", and the rest of the cast is fun to watch.  A classic!","7677":"We all loved this movie.","7678":"Absolutely enjoyable from beginning to end!","7679":"An amazing cast,finney,Burnett,Curry and Peters fantastic! Great for all ages.","7680":"ok but i don't like musicals","7681":"Great family film!  The kids all enjoyed it!!","7685":"love this movie","7686":"Terribly dull musical, full of annoying songs and terrible acting","7687":"Great movie. Thanks so much.","7688":"One of the best movies out there! It's even better watching it now than when I was a young child. Loved it then and love it now.","7694":"Enjoyable","7695":"Even a two year old enjoyed the music and dancing","7698":"Classic","7699":"A classic!","7700":"I thought this would be more child friendly, but the actions of the lady who ran the orphanage really ruined it for a family movie. My daughter didn't like it at all anyway so we didn't even finish it.","7701":"Great movie!!! It's a classic. My kids kids less than five years old were mesmerized throughout with tons of singing and dancing.","7702":"Funny happy","7705":"When I first heard mixed reviews on the film, I thought \"this movie is going to blow\".  Well, I went and saw it this past Saturday and let me say that this movie was, this year so far, the best horror film!\nI haven't finished the game on Playstation, but I have heard that the movie is pretty true to the game.  Great special effects plus a great plot plus a great cast makes this movie all worth while.","7708":"Superb!!","7712":"If you are a fan of the game or not, you will like Resident Evil. That is, if you can handle a scary movie. This one will have you jumping out of your seat. Scary stuff is around every corner. Eerie environments (like the spooky quiet rooms in the game), monsters that pop around corners, as well as the good ole blood and gore that accompany any resident evil game fill this movie. Watch it if you are ready to be scared!","7713":"Best kids\/girls movie of the 80's. Still love this movie!","7714":"My 7 year old daughter loved it. My 10 year old also enjoyed it. Timeless!","7715":"Great Movie. The signing and dancing was so fun. This was a movie that I grew up on and was happy to see that my boys enjoyed the movie and wanted to watch it twice.","7716":"Oldies are best","7717":"Love this movie","7718":"Loved this movie.  Much better than the later version.  Thanks.","7723":"I just got back from seeing \"Resident Evil\". The theater was packed with college kids out for a good time on a Saturday night.  They sure got it.  I was pleasantly surprised by how the movie managed to consistently dish out screams, laughs, and action-packed roller-coaster thrills. It's not Shakespeare, but it was a really entertaining movie.","7724":"delightful!","7725":"I enjoyed this movie this movie is not just for kids. As an adult I would recommend it to everyone young or old.","7726":"Very nice movie. Better that the newer one","7727":"really loved this movie..Such cuteness","7728":"This is the Annie I remember, with Carol Burnett. Love it!","7729":"I love musicals.  Great cast!","7730":"I do like seeing scary movies, so I saw previews for this so I thought I'd check it out. Well I liked it scared me to death if the filmakers make Resident Evil 2 hope they make it scarier all the zombies looked scary. So if you really like horror flicks go see this.","7731":"This movie was pretty cool. I'm a fairly big fan of the games, and I though it was well illustrated on film. The action was fast, the violence was gratuitous, and Milla Jovovich was sexy. ... Fun stuff. The zombies are creepy, and the licker (don't ask) is just plain freaky. Go see this flick. It's a fun time at the movies. ...","7733":"Ok, where do I start? The plot was dumb, the soundtrack was horrible, the acting was ridiculous, the zombies were even more ridiculous, there were splatter scenes thrown here and there to try to spice up the whole thing, and, finally, the spirit of the movie was sick. Could things get any worse than this?","7734":"My first time watching with my two grandchildren. One is in a school play of Annie. Touching storyline great acting and  wonderful singing. A great family film that makes you wonder about the plight of children without parents. Both Carol Burnett and Bernadett Peters as well as Albert Finney were great!","7735":"Great movie!","7736":"Good family night movie, entertaining","7737":"Great product! Fast delivery!","7738":":)","7745":"I really enjoyed it. I watched it while my Husband watched football. :-)","7746":"Wonderful old movie","7747":"love Carol Burnett, she is great with all her facial expressions","7748":"My grandchildren love Annie and sing all the songs, all the time.","7749":"Great movie","7750":"Classic!","7751":"Classic","7752":"A couple of t he best songs were deleted and new ones added.  The live stage version is much better.","7754":"Fun movie.","7755":"Better than expected.","7756":"Entertaining and funny. Love Carol Burnett","7757":"Grandchildren loved it.","7758":"just what I needed","7759":"One of only a few movies that when I rewatched it as an adult, it was just as good as I remembered as a child, or even better.","7760":"One of the worst movie versions of a great play I've ever seen.  Among the more significant misses in the movie: (1) changing the ending to an unnecessary death-like cliffhanger; and (2) turning the Mrs. Hannigan character into a drunk rather than someone who doesn't know how to deal with children and is terrified of them.  Absolutely awful.","7761":"Excellent!","7762":"Grand kids liked it","7763":"This Classic movie is up there with titles like \"Mary Poppins\", \"The sound of music\", \"It's a Wonderful Life\".","7764":"I never streamed Annie! So I have no opinion!","7765":"Love this movie","7766":"I don't care for musicals like this one. Kids singing voices, after awhile,  get on my nerves. This would have been better as play.","7767":"A classic; so refreshing to see again","7768":"All of the main characters deserved Oscars !  Wonderful music ! Good \"bad Characters\" Carol Burnett was magnificent.","7769":"classic that my 7 year old liked","7770":"Love this movie!  Pleased with my Purchase!","7771":"Annie is a classic and is even better on Blu-ray. As I say to my coworkers for most movies (there are a few I have had that look like they took the DVD and copied it to Blu-ray, they were that blurry), \"it's the best it's ever looked\". I think this, as most Blu-rays, look better than what was available in the theaters, at least for older movies. The sound was OK, nothing really outstanding, but at least the video was really good.","7772":"I love this movie and it's remake!","7773":"My kids were singing the songs for weeks","7774":"Always a good show for children.","7775":"Annie is a timeless classic that captures the hearts of children with its message of how love can soften even the hardest heart.","7776":"It's a great classic","7777":"Still one of the best movie musicals.  I put it on for my grandson and I enjoyed every minute.","7778":"A classic. This is a good family movie. One of my favs. Plus it's a original I grew up watching. A good way to watch something and enjoy and remember your child hood","7779":"excellent!","7780":"Good Blu-ray transfer, but I was not impressed with the story.","7781":"Good upbeat PG movie","7782":"wish they would make movies like this again","7783":"Cute","7784":"Great family movie!","7785":"Great movie for the whole family.","7786":"Really good, squeaky clean, family movie. It can be a hard-knock life, but luckily we've got America's favorite orphan to cheer us up.","7787":"THE  SHOW  WAS  VEVRY  GOOD,","7788":"the wife loves this kind of stuff. thinks it is great","7789":"Everyone loves Annie and so do I.","7790":"Always love Annie!","7791":"Great classic!","7792":"Enjoyable even if you've seen several versions of the movie","7793":"always a pleasure to watch!","7794":"I first saw this film when it originally aired on TV. I enjoyed the film so I purchased it. I love mountain climbing and wish I could do more of it. Films like this remind me just how dangerous the sport can be.\nOverall, it you're into outdoors or climbing and want to learn from other's mistakes without making your own, this is a film to watch. What happens when arrogance replaces common sense? What happens when you don't obey your own rules?","7795":"Awesome movie","7796":"I believe I have reviews this on a prior purchase.  It's a great story though other DVDs have come out with the same story.  This one was very impactful to me.  The book is even better -- just as good.","7797":"DVD was in nice shape & played well.  Thanks.","7798":"Great cast, especially Carol Burnett, who played the villainous woman in charge of the orphanage.","7799":"I read about this event in a Reader's Digest article many years ago. Upon seeing the film, the horror of what those climbers experienced had a much greater emotional impact. The special effects were awesome!! You had a sense of being right there with them. Remember those lost recently in the earthquake in Nepal.","7800":"Very Good Movie tho of course very sad too. The DVD played perfect and had no trouble with this seller and would purchase from them again.","7802":"I wonder if anyone who isn't actually compelled to climb a mountain can ever really understand these stories.  Nonetheless, they are spectacular and riveting.  I'm going to make another cup of hot chocolate.....","7803":"I purchased these for a teacher in my school district as requested. She has been very happy with them so far.","7804":"This movie was just okay.  I thought it was a different movie,  It was a good whoops though.  I wouldn't recommend this movie","7805":"Sad book, but learn a lot.","7806":"Excellent movie of course. Based on a true event. If you like K2 you will like this as well. Thanks","7807":"I read the book...very very interesting.  But this movie was impossible to understand unless you read the book.  Why oh why did they spend the money to make this?  This is probably a tribute to a guilty conscience. .","7808":"Even through it's an old movie it never gets old. Somethings last for a lifetime.","7809":"The best ever!","7810":"kids watch constantly","7812":"The Bottom Line:\n\nA quickly-put-together and unconvincing version of Krakauer's amazing book, Into Thin Air (and other movies like it, obviously) is the reason why \"TV movie\" is a pejorative term; rewriting real people to make heroes and villains and condensing everything into a tidy 100 minute block, Into Thin Air is depressingly bad.","7814":"Excellent","7815":"Love it","7820":"Very nicely made movie. With since of humor and warmth.","7821":"Simply Wonderful!","7822":"This is, by far, the best production of Annie off the stage I've ever seen!","7829":"Great classic movie","7830":"An oldie but a goody.  Carol Bernett and Bernidet Peters were young and a lot of fun.","7831":"Love Annie, Watched it when I was a kid and enjoy watching it more with my children.","7832":"Excellent movie; my kids and grandkids enjoyed it!","7833":"My first rating was only one star,  but I meant to give five\n\nMy kids (students) loved it.  It was great for teaching about FDR, The New Deal, The Great Depression,  Capitalism and socialism.  It's better than I remembered it","7834":"My 3-year old granddaughter loves ANNIE!","7835":"CLASSIC","7836":"Adorable movie. Great dancing and singing. Perfect old movie fun for the whole family.","7838":"As much fun to watch today as it was when it first came out.","7839":"Good","7840":"The best!","7841":"Nothing beats Annie!","7842":"Just fun!","7843":"Great musical up lifting","7844":"an all time favorite movie.  My kids and I love it.","7845":"My daughter and I really enjoyed watching Annie.","7846":"My grandkids love it","7847":"This version is great.  I watched it for the first time with my little great niece.","7848":"This was a good movie with lots of feeling, entertainment and we enjoyed it immensely.","7849":"This movie is a classic!!!!","7850":"Granddaughter loves it EVERY time she watches.","7851":"Great music, acting and just the classic done right.\n\nMy 6 year old daughter loves to watch it over and over.","7852":"One of the best musicals ever made . It is funny , witty and the little kids can really sing .","7853":"Love this movie! A feel good film!","7854":"Very good","7855":"Not a fan","7856":"Love it!","7857":"Classic! My two year old loves singing along to this movie. Definitely need to FF through a few parts that I don't want her hearing or seeing.","7858":"Bought for MIL who loves this movie.","7859":"Have not seen this BUT if is like the org. it should be good","7860":"Definitely 5 stars. Our little girls love the movie.","7861":"Everything pm","7862":"You can't beat the original Annie!","7863":"I love this version of the Annie movie. It is cannot be redone by other actors. This is the true Annie movie of all time.","7864":"love it","7865":"I really like Annie. I have seen it before","7866":"We loved it.","7867":"This movie is a classic that every child should watch!","7868":"Great movie! Love Carol Burnett in it.","7869":"I'd never seen Annie, but knew in the day it got rave reviews. I thought it was fun, just sheer entertainment with great actors.","7870":"always a family favorite!","7871":"I have loved this movie since I was a little girl","7872":"Kids love it.","7873":"Absolutely adore the original film and so grateful I was able to find a copy of the original in such excellent condition to share with my family again!! Thank you!!","7874":"Delightful musical.","7875":"Always a favorite in our home and now with my very young granddaughter.","7876":"Classic music and storylines -- contemporary character development. Annie is a dear and she brings out tie worst and the best in her cast mates. By the end of the show characters get their just desserts before your very eyes and delight us for forever!","7877":"Have always loved this movie","7878":"The old classic and my kids loved it!!","7879":"Good","7880":"If I've seen this 5x... I've seen this 50x!!! My granddaughter is now 5 and knows all the songs.  (Me too).  Soon, I will be sharing with the next group of grandkids.  Love it!","7881":"Love this movie","7882":"My 7 year old daughter got this for Christmas and LOVES it!","7883":"great movie","7884":"Wonderful use of 2 hours. Acting superb. Familiar story line takes you away to a different place.","7885":"Always enjoy watching this","7886":"This may not even be that great, but I am rating it purely on nostalgic value. Just watched it with my 2 year old who is suddenly into musicals. I was surprised- she actually liked it! Sat through 3\/4ths of it, and dug the songs. I still love this as one of my all-time favorite movies from childhood. Worth the re-watch, especially for the incredibly young Tim Curry!","7887":"Plot was ok. Parts were quite unrealistic. Lying 1 star off. Immodesty and obvious promiscuity another 2 stars off. There is more. Those out there might not see how we do, but perhaps so.","7888":"Great classic to watch with the children","7889":"Great flick","7890":"First class entertainment !  They just don't make' em like this anymore.  Awesome improvement from well loved VHS . Image quality & sound excellent!","7891":"Great classic!","7892":"Annie is a classic, a fun family film.","7893":"Excellent musical, wonderful for the whole family.","7894":"Great Family Movie","7895":"Good Quality!","7896":"outstanding it is peobaly how some ophan homes are conduct","7897":"A wonderful film!","7898":"great classic","7899":"This is one of my favorite movies from when I was a kid. I love the songs, and I absolutely love Carol Burnett and Tim Curry. Great movie!","7900":"A fun movie with great acting","7901":"It's a fun movie, with good actors, well written, and some Carol Burnett has some great lines. Funny and talented as ever.","7903":"Loves it. The movie streaming quality was good and the storyline was as I remembered it.","7904":"Always a good show, first time of repeat - superior to more recent remake, especially the Carol Burnette role which should have generated an Academy notice.","7905":"I watched this as a kid and now my children love it as much as I do. A great family movie!","7906":"What a great movie!","7907":"Classic movie.  The songs will be stuck in your head for the next few days, so fair warning.","7908":"Good Classic Family Movie","7909":"My 9 year old loved the movie way better than the new version.","7910":"Very annoying singing voices.  I did not enjoy this at all.","7911":"My 2 year old asked to watch the original Annie.  She loves this movie and so do I.","7912":"My 5 year old daughter absolutely loved it.","7913":"Good clean family fun.","7914":"A fun movie for the whole family!  This version of Annie is my family's favorite.","7915":"Love Annie always will! :)","7916":"This Jackie Chan-produced film is a wonderfully entertaining taste of the next generation of Hong Kong films.  This film has a very MTV feel to it, the way it fuses popular music, fashion and martial arts.  The script is forgettable, but who cares.  Even the fight scenes aren't as crisp as anything Chan would do, but, once again, who cares.  This movie is meant to be a one-and-a-half hour daydream,  and it works.  Highly recommended!","7919":"This is the original Annie, one of the best movies made, my granddaughter watches it over and over again. Sweet story.","7920":"Wonderful each time I watch it...10stars!","7925":"We love the movie Annie! I watched this movie as a kid and am thrilled that I now get to watch it with my kids. It's a nice, classic movie and nothing beats watching the original as opposed to all the remakes","7926":"Great family flick","7927":"It's a terrific movie!","7928":"Of course it was great. Even my baby loved the singing and dancing.","7929":"Bought this movie as a Christmas present for my great-grandson who always asks to see it when he comes to visit.","7930":"Classic!","7931":"Great","7932":"A classic for children and grownups to watch together!  Love this version.  Super fast delivery and great packaging.","7933":"Watched the movie to prepare for son's play","7934":"great movie and great service.","7935":"As described.","7936":"old time favorite","7937":"Carol Burnett at her best and a real good supporting cast.","7938":"Great musical!","7940":"Love this movie. Watched it again for first time in 33 years ! Watched it with my 9 year old son, he loved it too!","7941":"Excellent","7942":"Great movie!  It's one of my Grand daughters favorites.","7943":"This rendition of Annie is old I know, but still my personal favorite.  It disappeared from the shelf, so had to order this movie again.","7944":"fine movie.","7945":"Annie is a fun musical with a lovable star. Supporting actors Carol Burnett and Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry are brilliant. Good guy and bad guys abound as Annie and her dog find a home for themselves.","7946":"Top-drawer entertainment. My youngest (5 yrs) granddaughter loves it. Catchy songs, and just good screen-writing.","7947":"An excellent Classic.","7948":"ok","7949":"great","7951":"None","7952":"Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled.  :)","7953":"Still our favorite version of this story.  The remakes have been ok, the original is lively, heartwarming, and delightful.","7954":"The sound was so low that I couldn't hear it -- even with a headphone.  I'll probably end up giving it to a friend who has exceptional hearing.","7955":"kids watch it constantly.","7956":"my daughter had never seen this classic. needless to say, she loved this timeless movies.","7957":"always love this one","7958":"Annie is a great story and the film is up to the task. Performances are superb and the music is wonderful. I loved the stage musical but I loved the ending in the movie version even better. My granddaughter age 6 also really enjoyed it.","7959":"also the same as the other","7960":"GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!!!","7961":"There were so many extra scenes that were otherwise deleted in the main release of the film. I know this film inch by inch so the new scenes stood out. I understand why they trimmed the fat but it's a nice treat for Annie fans to see the extra songs and dances.","7962":"Bought it as a gift .. not my thing.","7963":"My favorite movie.","7964":"My 3-year old knows all the songs. I'm not sure if I should be proud or embarrassed","7965":"Excellent movie.  Enjoyed it all over again with my 6 year old grandchild.","7966":"Fantastic! I jumped out of my seat when she went to the mansion! (I'm trying not to post any spoilers) It was opulent, amazing, Beaux Arts architecture, phantom rolls royces here and there, it was just a joy to watch that part. And the MUSIC, fantastic! A great family movie if you have toddlers.","7967":"This is a good movie","7968":"Granddaughters agedv7 and 9 wanted to see it, they liked  it","7969":"My daughter did not want to watch this when I first pulled it up.  She was stuck watching animated movies, over and over.  When we watched this together she watched it over and over and now requests Annie soundtrack to be played while we're driving around.","7970":"little ones in any place will love this one for sure","7971":"Just what I wanted!","7972":"Love the original better than any other version!! Purchased for my daughter to take to college with her.","7973":"Great!","7974":"Grand kids love it and so do all of us grownups","7975":"I got tis for my 8 year old Granddaughter. We watched it together and she loved it, even - as she puts it - \"10 million, thousand, hundred time more\" than the current \"Annie\" movie. Don't ya just gotta love what kids sometimes say.","7976":"The DVD replaces my VHS, which I have always liked. The VHS went into donations for someone else to enjoy","7977":"I like the movie. She lives in a palace. It is really big. They wear fancy clothes. The colors are really bright. I think living in the palace is really great and fun.","7978":"Annie is always wonderful no matter what age you are...the adults, and the kids pulled this movie together for all ages","7979":"Great movie with a good story and moral...something lacking in movies now days for kids.  Acting is great and music is catchy, making you want to sing and dance along.","7980":"Always a pleasure to watch this classic!!!  I find myself singing the songs for days after I've watched it!  So much fun!!!","7981":"So this movie for the first time at a Drive in when I was a child.  Hard to believe it is now on DVD and Bluray","7982":"Good classic to watch","7983":"Oldie but a goodie!","7984":"A classic musical play captured in film and is very well done. 5 stars for sure!","7985":"It's a wonderful movie for children and even adults. It's a shame that my grandson can't enjoy this good movie because Amazon Prime decided to eliminate it from its service.","7986":"This was one of my favorites growing up and is now my Daughter's favorite.  Love Annie.","7987":"I watched this with my granddaughter, and she enjoyed the musical numbers very well. Although this is a movie from the 80's, this Annie is much better than the most recent version with Jamie Foxx. The song and dance routines are particularly good, and you can see that many Broadway actors are featured.","7988":"Was a good movie. I watched it with my granddaughters and they enjoyed it also. They have seen it several times.","7989":"Best version of Annie","7990":"good movie","7991":"A fantastic family movie for all ages. The music is terrific, the actors were fabulous and a well loved show in our home. Our children still get a kick when my husband and I repeat a scene along with the actor or sing the songs. A clean movie, without all the garbage too many movies have today.","7992":"Loved this movie since I was a little girl and I still love it!!!","7993":"A classic !","7994":"Come on, who needs another rave review of \"Annie\"?  Any movie buff knows this movie is a True Classic.  The sound track is worth the price.","7995":"I enjoyed this a lot.","7996":"First time my six year old saw Annie. And, she absolutely loved it!","7997":"This was the best of all the Annie movies and Television specials.  Annie is cute and sassy and her dog Sandy steals the picture.  It was also shot at my college, Monmouth College, now Monmouth University in Long Branch, NJ.  Wilson Hall never looked more beautiful.  The singing and dancing were great and I just loved it.","7998":"great quality!","7999":"great","8000":"I'm so happy this is on PrimeI've been able to introduce this to my 3 1\/2 year old and he LOVES it!","8001":"This is a masterpiece that the old as well as the new generation will always love.","8002":"Classic! Love it! So happy my kids love it as much as me:)","8003":"Love the movie and now we have it for our family in widescreen.\n\nBob T.","8004":"as described","8005":"A great movie that played well!","8006":"Incredibly moving. This was my first viewing. I can't believe I waited this long to see it. Don't wait!","8007":"Have this on Amazon and 2 DVDs love this movie","8008":"An awesome movie.","8009":"awesome acting, cinematography, and story.  Highly recommend it!","8010":"great classic.","8011":"Well done, if you enjoy the musical, and I do. But I much prefer the 1999 TV movie with Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Alan Cumming, and Audra McDonald. Everything is superior in the TV version, and I recommend it over this version.","8012":"Masterfully done...a hauntingly beautiful movie","8013":"required text","8014":"I have read the book and seen this film many times.","8015":"Excellent condition","8016":"My fav. A true classic. Me and my girls watch it over and over singing and dancing","8017":"Our kids (ages 7, 4 and 2) love this movie!!  It's on their list of top 10 movies.","8018":"Beautiful tribute to the book.","8019":"Got boring, too much foul language, blasphemy, and a nude scene. Would have been great without these things","8021":"Poor acting, directing, and script.  If you are looking for quality entertainment... better to look in a cat's hairball.","8022":"Amazing","8024":"Not much more can be said for this original version of Annie other than, the writer, the actors  and us viewers are all part of one great big family  for a short while.... Thank you for taking us there","8025":"Did not get finish watching, because something came up. what I had seen I rather enjoyed.","8026":"This is a classic the original great movie","8027":"Awesome film,They tired to remake it, lol, Somehow that never works out!! The film takes you trough our nations roughest times in the 1930's Herbert Hoover a chicken in every pot!! The sun does come out tomorrow!!","8029":"We should all, look back and remember a time that reminds us of this sort.","8030":"Great Movie!","8031":"Its a great movie. I recommend","8032":"They simply just don't make movies like this anymoreit is indeed sad. I laughed. I cried. I walked down memory lane, thinking back to the days when my own father taught me how to flyfishwhen he is gone, I will always have that treasure, in my memory, that only a father can share with his son. 5 star masterpiece, and one of the best movies, in my opinion, ever made!","8033":"All I can say is this has become one of my favorite movies.","8034":"Good movie.","8035":"Love this movie and have for years!","8036":"I think this is the first time that I've watched a movie that was better than the book on which it was based.  The Montana landscape is indescribably beautiful. No words can do it justice.  It must be seen. Also, there was quite a lot in the book about the intricate art and skill of fly fishing. The movie emphasized relationships and family dynamics which I found more interesting. The movie was beautifully done. I will probably watch it again sometime just for the scenery.","8038":"Watched this cd twice since receiving it.  Love it still.","8039":"My favorite","8040":"This movie is supurb. I really liked the whole movie. I'll be watching it several times. Thanks for a great production.","8041":"Great Classic","8042":"Loved it","8043":"This is a classic film.  It is by turns touching, funny, heart wrenching and beautiful.  I had seen it years ago and am delighted to report that it holds up well.  The filming is breathtaking and the actors create honest, touching characters in this coming of age film.  It brings depth, humor and truth to the story a young men coming of age.  Timeless.","8044":"The cinematography is outstanding as well as the story itself, casting, the era portrayal and the characters were all outstanding.","8045":"okat","8047":"BEAUTIFUL FILM. IF YOU LOVE THE SIMPLICITY AND AWE OF NATURE EMBEDDED IN A STORY OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF FAMILY.\nTHE FLY FISHING SCENES ARE AMAZING. THE STORY AND ACTING ARE SUPERB. ROBERT REDFORD DIRECTED THIS GEM.","8048":"thanks","8049":"Great!","8050":"Grandkids loved it","8051":"I must have seen this movie 100 times by now. It is the reason I started fly fishing as a kid. Do yourself a favor and take 90 minutes to watch this gem!","8052":"Fantastic Movie","8053":"Beautiful movie is entirely faithful to beautiful book that inspired it.","8054":"good","8055":"Great movie depicting family life of growing up.","8056":"A-OK","8057":"I purchased this for my adult son as an inspiration. The scenery is greaat too.","8058":"Cute. Brings back memories. A bit too long","8059":"Made my day. Enjoying the movie with my grand children.","8060":"Classic. Young Brad Pitt. What more could you want? Great family dynamics","8061":"great","8062":"Very good photography,generally well acted and spectacular scenery! The only downside is the rather formulaic young Brad Pitt gifted and pretty though deeply flawed character he brings to all too many movies.","8063":"as advertised","8064":"One of my favorite all time movies!  Brings out every family related emotion experienced by most.","8065":"Loved it, still a classic! For days when the sun doesn't come out but needs a little help :)","8067":"One of the best movies I've ever seen.","8068":"I  love watching this movie. I don't think I will get tired of it.","8069":"Robert Redford's narration is excellent.  A must watch for those who love fly-fishing or watching it.  This story of the MacLean brothers may be sad, but it is a great movie.","8070":"A River Runs Through It one of the best movies I have seen.","8071":"This is really a great film.  There are a lot of hidden, sort of read between the lines stuff in the screen play.  A wonderful film, about life and time.","8072":"One of those really good shows.","8073":"It's Classic!","8074":"My daughter watched this with me on Netflix when she was 1 1\/2 and loved it. She loves the singing and has asked to watch \"Annie\" and has started to sing along with \"tomorrow\"\n\nI loved this as a child and so glad she likes it as well and for under $5 I thought it was a great deal.","8075":"great movie","8076":"Movie was better than I expected.  Cast and music was great.  The DVD audio was poor, streaming much better.","8077":"Beautifully directed, a must-see.","8078":"Fantastic movie","8079":"Perfect","8080":"It did and then some","8081":"My granddaughter tried to watch this three times and found it boring.  As did I.  One would have to be an Annie fan to enjoy this.","8082":"Extraordinary movie for Fly fishermen & anyone who likes a good drama, as it's also a story about a particular type of family structure--and how it affects the two boys.  Brad Pitt gave an excellent performance in this first of his two drama movies (Legends of The Fall being 2nd); shame he didn't stick with drama--rather than \"blow 'em up\" actions--as he is at least another James Dean ('50s).\nLots to enjoy & good scenery also.","8083":"Love it!","8084":"Great movie!","8085":"A nice movie to watch with family","8086":"Great quality, no problems streaming.","8087":"I introduced Annie for the first time to my 12-year-old step son who's really into musicals, and he really liked it. It was my favorite musical\/movie in the 80s when I was 10 or so, and watching it again for the first time in 20-some-odd years brought back a lot of fun memories. It also reminded me of just how incredible Carol Burnett's performance was--something I couldn't fully appreciate as a child. Enjoy!","8088":"We all know this is a classic............","8089":"It's a good adaptation of the best non-fiction book ever written.","8090":"Great movie, would recommend to all","8091":"I did not expect to like it, but found it really entertaining.  The cast was really great, and the plot is what caught my attention. I would have given it a 5-star, except I thought the singing was long in places.  Other than that, the movie flowed.","8092":"Very good product.","8093":"Have seen it before but liked it more the second time around now that I'm older.","8094":"A good story showing a young Brad Pitt","8095":"The music and the photography are magnificent. The  story of two brothers going their separate ways in life and the historical accuracy of the Twenties in Montana are spot on. The theme joins all of the divergent paths in life with fishing and the \"waters\" as a common thread which, no matter how different we may seem, joins all of mankind together.  Superb.","8096":"It's a slow musical movie but is a decent story","8097":"good","8098":"Great DVD.","8099":"One of my favorites & the scenery fascinates me!","8100":"I never saw this in the theater nor do I remember hearing anything about it...I stumbled across this movie, from the beginning, channel surfing. What a surprise! I love this movie! Just...watch it, first, by yourself actually...honestly, too avoid naive commentary.","8101":"Can't beat then classics my two daughters loves this movie","8102":"I wanted to be Annie.","8103":"Fantastic movie... can relate with many characters","8104":"The picture and screnery are WOW.","8105":"Excellent!  Beautiful scenery, good story.","8106":"Absolutely spectacular","8107":"all time favorite movie","8108":"Good movie. Get's you thinking about life.","8109":"great product, great price, fast delivery.","8110":"I have never seen this at 47 years old. My 4.5 year old loves it and so did I.","8111":"I loved it as a kid, but there's some weird stuff in here. The portrayals of Punjab and the Asp are weirdly racist and the acting and dance routines are pretty stilted. My daughter didn't understand the concept of Miss Hannigan, and I kind of didn't like the idea of saying \"We love you Miss Hannigan\" by rote even though they hated her. The songs are delightful and it was a trip down memory lane, but we're not adding this to our collection.","8112":"very good","8113":"Luv Annie","8114":"Delightful!!","8115":"Great movie","8116":"great","8117":"\"Someday, you will write the story of our family.\" The father tells his son in this film. That was a call to all of us to somehow record who and what we are--the story of your family. In the case of this family, a \"river ran through it.\" What is it for you and your family? A deeply thoughtful, quietly inspiring film.","8118":"Great family movie. Very talented performers.","8119":"Love, love, love this movie. Just wish it didn't have the one cuss word in it. My grandkids have to wait to watch due to that. But as a musical hands down one of the best","8120":"I grew up there and then.  We all need to learn to live our lives as individuals.  Worth buying","8121":"Great Item","8122":"excellent","8123":"A \"River runs through it,\"remains  one of the iconic masterpieces in USA cinema. Robert Redford has devoted his entire life to movies via acting, writing and directing, none have been more radiant that \"River\".....","8124":"Granddaughters favorite","8125":"Fun and warm watch","8126":"I've always wanted to see this musical.  I enjoyed it.  Another one to take off my bucket list!!","8127":"My family really loved this movie!","8128":"Great movie! Fast shipping!","8129":"Great movie about times gone by in Montana.","8130":"One of the best movies made.","8131":"Haunting.","8132":"if you  are person with depth  who appreciates characters and good performances have a watch","8133":"All time great musical - Great cast!!!","8134":"great movie","8135":"This movie is an outstanding example of Robert Redford's excellent skills and techniques in storytelling of drama.  He allows the audience to decide for themselves if the characters should be admired or not.  As director, he stands in the story objectively to help the audience understand, believing overall that it is much bigger than just itself.","8136":"Beautiful character study.  Filmed with an artists' eye.  A bit slow ~ particularly when compared with the pace and movement of today's action packed films.  My 16 year old couldn't sit still and watch it ~ which was a loss for him.  This is the kind of movie that stays with you and makes you think about life and relationships.","8137":"great show","8138":"Even if you don't enjoy fly fishing this movie is an exceptional coming of age story especially because it is true. McLean's writing is nearly poetic and the movie holds up well. An homage to the early west, education and, yes, fly fishing.","8139":"there are quite a few levels to this movie, and it is well done at all of them.","8140":"One of my all time favorites.  Decided to quit borrowing the DVD and got my own copy.  It's a great movie and a wonderful tribute to the grandeur of  America the Beautiful.","8141":"A truly great movie.","8142":"Another favorite.","8143":"Great movie","8144":"Classic...I like it better each time I see it.  And I've watched it for 20 years.","8145":"This film is, from start to finish, an excellent rendition of the book.  It does a marvelous job of explaining the inexplicable; a story about a young man who had so many gifts and talents, yet squandered them all, which ultimately led to his self-destruction.  The beautiful photography keeps you mesmerized.  The acting is flawless.  A must-see movie!","8146":"My granddaughter watches it back to back on the weekends. She loves it.","8147":"Love this movie!","8148":"The movie we remember from our childhood served up with some great extras.  You will love it.","8149":"This is a classic movie.","8150":"As advertised. Timely delivery at a good price.","8151":"Great movie.  Like watching an old friend.","8152":"A beautiful told story set in the country\/city of Helena MT. A real life story of Mr. McClane. A movie that fishermen and non fishermen alike will enjoy.","8153":"Absolutely superb movie.  This is another deep movie and on the edge with feelings.","8154":"Excellent","8155":"Very good casting.  Very good screenplay.","8156":"Very slow, pointless at times........seemed to be going aimlessly down the river.","8157":"No one should go through life and not see Annie! It's a classic !","8158":"Great shape good movie","8159":"Beautifully done.  Casting was perfect and the scenary was\nmatchless.","8160":"Lived in Montana so we can recognize the rivers they used in the film.  Something very calming about watching it. It's like watching an artist paint a picture.","8161":"Second best movie Brad Pitt ever acted in! Typical turn of the century Americana story, brilliantly filmed and told. Skerritt should have walked away with best supporting actor in this movie!","8162":"I have seen this movie several times and wanted to watch it again. If a movie could receive 10 stars I would give this one 10. The acting, storyline and execution of both were excellent! I love all the characters, actors especially Anthony Hopkins and his role in this movie. I was a teacher for many years and can tell you that after this movie was released, a few years later I had many \"Tristen's\" in my class both boys and girls!!","8163":"I love this movie.","8165":"Beautiful scenery and inspirational theme along with stellar cast.  Well worth watching.","8166":"Great Movie!!","8167":"Wasn't what I was expecting.","8168":"Annie is one of our daughters favorite movies!!!  It is such a fantastic movie.  The entire family enjoys it!!!","8169":"GREAT","8170":"Love Carol Burnett in anything!!","8171":"great movie","8172":"An unusual movie that develops beautifully throughout its length.  Lots of great scenery and suspense throughout.  If you are like most of  us you will want to see this one again to get its full impact.  Go for it!!!","8173":"Great movie, great price, fast shipping, highly recommended this movie.","8174":"I saw it on TV the other evening and decided I must get the tape. It's Filled with 70;s Era fashion photographers cliches such as putting beautiful models in sexy poses, some of the S&M variety.\nFaye Dunaway  is georgeous and mysterious looking as always.\nEven though for some  reason it has not been reviewed by major critics, I recommend it highly.","8175":"I truly believe throughout the entire film that Laura Mars was innocent. I couldn't wait to find out who the ture killer was.  Great Supporting cast of Tommy Lee Jones and Raul Julia.","8176":"Boring and sentimental memories of one's formative years in Montana.\n\nI kept waiting for something of interest but the experiences were mostly banal, and the nostalgia and philosophizing\nleft me cold.\n\nIs this what is considered good literature today?","8177":"I like this movie because there is enough action in it and shows how Kevin Costner is so peaceful in finding himself and living off the land.","8178":"Great condition.","8179":"great movie","8180":"Robert Redfords best movie.","8181":"Thx","8182":"Thank you very much","8183":"great movie everyone enjoyed it especially our 6 year old granddaughter, great music, singing, story and stars.  Loved this older version.","8184":"Just fun to watch again and again.  Advertisers are always using \"The Sun Will Come Up Tomorrow\" in their commercials.  Why?  'Cause it has a happy ending.  Cast is great.  Fun watch.","8185":"Good fun for a family movie.  Very cute Annie.","8186":"A childhood favorite...still so good!","8187":"Enjoyable. I like this version much better than the new one out now.","8189":"I like this movie so very much I have watched it over and over.\nbeautiful scenery and great acting make it a plus.","8190":"We really enjoyed this movie. Had heard a lot about it and were not disappointed. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well.","8192":"great classic movie.  Fun.","8193":"This one's a really good thriller\/mystery. The disc is two-sided so you get the film in widescreen and in full screen. It has subtitles and closed captions and the director's commentary track.","8194":"You know what I like the 1970's stuff in this movie but over all it really kind of stank.  The modeling stuff, Faye Dunaway, 1970's stuff all cool but a bad movie","8196":"Good, very, unusual dilm..it is From Its Time, I'd Say :)))","8197":"Loved the suspense and drama. I enjoy the older movies, the way they dressed and spoke in the 70's. Faye Dunaway is such a classic!","8198":"Classic late 70's crime thriller with Dunaway in top form. Classic disco soundtrack. Highly recommended!","8199":"This movie will always be a classic.","8200":"Everyone out of this world. Can't go wrong with Pitt and Skerritt. Robert Redford great director. Glad he directed other movies.","8201":"Very well written. Wasn't this a true story. Beautiful scenery I think the older man on the rock fishing was a grandson of one of the boys.","8203":"One of my favorites.","8204":"Had to purchase this one, since I loved the cinema version so much that I paid to watch that twice. Now I can see what I think in PC-screen size!","8205":"Never connected with the comic strip and the same thing with the movie, watched it from start to finish got rather tired of \"Tomorrow\"","8206":"I looooove this movie but it buffers ever two minutes!  I watched it on Netflix with no buffering. Disappointed","8207":"Gripping movie, even though it's kind of obvious how it would end.\nTommy Lee Jones is extremely magnetic and intense. His history has shown him to be a very versatile actor, one of the very best.\nReally enjoyed looking at the fashion and style from the 70s. What a far cry from today's tackiness!","8208":"Stylish 70's thriller with great soundtrack.\nLove the late 70's fashion, photography, interior design and music.  This movie has some terrific disco tunes.\nWonderful NY scenery, and a good performance from Faye Dunaway, along with the supporting cast of regulars.","8209":"Not as great as I had hoped. So of tired....","8210":"Very enjoyable","8211":"Great movie. If you liked legends of the fall, then this might be up your alley.","8212":"Classic, who doesn't like Annie! My 5 year old watched it and he was singing all the songs for the next 3 days! Good, clean, child friendly movie!","8213":"This movie is a timeless classic. I don't even know how many times I've seen it but it always comes through with great entertainment and leaves you feeling a little bit happier about being alive.","8214":"This was the first time I saw this movie and it is ranked as one of my all-time favorites.  Love the cast.  Love the clothes.  Makes you want to take up fly-fishing.","8215":"What can I say?  This is a man's movie.  Call me a chauvinist or anything else except late for dinner but this is a fine work, a neglected work, a work of passion and greatness.","8216":"Good Movie","8217":"Love, Love this movie. Funny, crazy, the greatest songs and Carol Brunette.\nWhat's even cooler is listening to my 5 yr. granddaughter singing the songs.","8218":"very riveting it had me on the edge of my seat","8219":"Nail Biter!","8220":"A vivid story that captures you from beginning to end of the life of two young boys living in Montana.","8221":"A really interesting story of an early 20th century preacher and his wife and 2 sons whom he brought up loving fly fishing. The family grew up in Montana.","8222":"A wonderful movie. Sad but with a great sory about two brothers who share one love with their father. Fly fishing. I have watched it several times and will again I think.","8223":"A telling of a very tragic event.  It changed the way fire is fought\nin the mountains of Montana since.  I have not watched the film\nyet but I have read the book.  It has been fifty years ago since this\ntragedy happened.  At the bottom of the hill is a picnic area and\ninformation signs.  It is accessed only by boat.","8224":"If you like any movies about this era in time with an great outdoors back drop, then chances are you will like this movie. It's a great story.","8225":"Once a classic always a classic...","8226":"The whole family enjoyed this quality musical.","8227":"Family Classic","8228":"very good movie.","8229":"This is the best scare I have had in a long time. Faye Dunaway and the rest of the cast, including Tommy Lee Jones are masterful\nin the telling of this story, Having the power to see a killer doing his business would scare the hell out of me, and this movie comes\nthrough in every aspect.  I recommend it highly  5 Stars","8230":"Just love this old movie. still scares me","8231":"good suspense and great twist ending","8232":"Good movie.","8233":"love it - thanks","8234":"Carol Burnett was wow in this movie...thank you","8235":"great movie the originals the best , a must see","8236":"Good family movie.","8237":"This was actually the sing a long dvd and not the actual movie.  My bad.","8238":"Our granddaughter saw a school play and loved the music, so we purchased this for a Christmas present for her.  She watched Christmas day and her parent report she has watched three or four more times with her friends or just by herself.","8239":"A Classic Story about characters we love. A must have for any movie collector.","8240":"Not a bad movie.  There were lulls at times, but maybe you have to be a lover of fly fishing.  Ongoing narrative by the older brother, Norman, from childhood to adulthood.  Would have liked a somewhat different ending for Brad Pitt's character.\nTo me a better sibling brothers movie to watch as the characters grow older is Legends of the Fall, also with Brad Pitt.","8241":"I lived back when this movie takes place.  Today's generation would have trouble understanding the agenda.  It was well done but slow moving.","8242":"The film was intriguing.  Faye Dunaway is a good actor.  Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints.  See more at dovegroup at weebly dot com.","8243":"Loved this movie","8244":"Good movie","8246":"This is an American Classic. Amazing movie!!!!!!","8247":"This is one of the best movies made. Watch it through out the year. Enjoy watching it. The actors are great in their roles they play. The actor who plays Annie is just great and tells the story in a great way with here acting.","8248":"Great classic movie","8249":"This product was exactly what I was looking for.  I like that I can order it and have at my door in just a few days","8250":"So refreshing to watch a clean-cut movie of real people.  One title for this movie could have been \"The Americans\".  A rousing, heart stirring story set in one of the most beautiful places in the world. All the tallented actors were excellent, but when it comes to playing the charming bad boy, no one does it better than Brad Pitt. Loved this movie.","8251":"Terrific scenery! Loved the casting\/fishing sequences but the actual movie dragged at times. The narrator's voice could be irritating after a while.","8252":"Marvelous, just marvelous. Worth every penny of it. I am buying all of the old Robert Redford films. I am enjoying them all.","8253":"There are a couple of life lessons presented in the video and in my opinion are tied to the art of fly fishing. I have long held that women would do well to understand American football in order to understand men and men would do well to understand baseball in order to understand women. One more adage: women and men would do well to understand fly fishing in order to understand each other.","8254":"The story of a young woman (Marisa Tomei) who travels all the way to Italy to search for her soulmate even though she is getting married in days. All  the performers are great especially Bonnie Hunt. I hope she wins some  awards someday. Beautiful scenery of Italy is wonderfully captured in this  great looking DVD. Nothing happening in the 5.1 surround sound but again  this is not \"Die Hard\" kind of movies. Get this, you won't be  sorry.","8255":"Didn't see the Broadway play, but I like Albert Finney in this movie.  Classic.","8256":"Perfect gift for children!","8258":"Received as expected in a timely fashion.","8259":"movie","8260":"classic!","8261":"Love this movie.  Love the music.  Quality is good.","8262":"Amazing!","8263":"Great","8266":"Love The Actor line up. This is back when they were young & good looking! A decent mystery story for the time! A +","8267":"That's it. Didn't get all the hype. Not bad just not great at least for me. Just my opinion, you may love it!\nWell, there is Brad Pitt!","8268":"I loved this movie. It reminded me of my childhood. I sure miss fishing! After watching this I wanted to tie a fly on go out fishing.","8269":"For every Movie Fan's collection of Classic movies.  The ending is worth it all.  Read on line about the author and main character of the movie.  Wonderful person, wonderful story.  A true Americana piece.","8270":"Good","8271":"my favorite make of this movie","8272":"Best Annie movie ever!","8273":"Great, quality product @ a great price.","8274":"The cover made him salivate -- fishing addict that he is.  He was disappointed that the script was limited to more drama than trolling  but liked it anyway.","8275":"A captivating portal of family life in Montana in the early 1900's. Terrific acting, beautiful scenery, and wonderful music. In my top 25 of all movies..","8276":"It has all the softness of a warm Spring rain and the sadness of the death of youth.  One of my all time favs.","8277":"A lovely film that I have seen twice.  The acting is superb and the scenery is mystical.  This movie made me want to learn to flyfish and I can see how easily it was to write a story around this beautiful art form and relate it to a family struggling to find peace.","8279":"Bizarre premise.  First time I saw Tommy Lee Jones.  Faye Dunaway is great.  Suspenseful.  Not for kids (nudity and violence).","8282":"Love this wonderful movie.  It's fun, entertaining, & the acting is of course, superb.  With the charming Marisa Tomei, impish & romantic Robert Downey Jr., & beautiful Bonnie Hunt, how could it be anything else?!  Thoroughly enjoyable & I highly recommend it.  :)  jlp","8283":"Very good.","8285":"This was a gift.  My daughter loved it.","8286":"Great transaction, no problems","8287":"This is and has always been the best version of this story. Carol Burnett does an amazing job.","8288":"Great movie, I recommend.","8289":"This movie resonates with me on a dozen different levels!  I've watched it probably a dozen times or more and enjoy it more each time!","8290":"Norman Maclean's novella is a marvel. Using the setting of a big river and the art of fly fishing, he explores family relationships and the very different lives of two sons. It's absorbing, beautiful and tragic, but the narrator (Norman) does come to an understanding of why what's happened, has.","8291":"Directed and narrated by Robert Redford, his voice weaves together the story of a family in Montana whose lives center around their love for each other. and the river that cuts through their area. I've seen this movie several times and return to it because it's more than a story about a family....it's about  our own lives, too, and the impermanence we all eventually face yet the river continues to run right through it all","8292":"Great love comedy.","8293":"Great movie, good packaging","8294":"A awesome movie.","8296":"This 2000 edition of the DVD is awesome! Contains widescreen & full screen version. Digital image of the film is great!","8297":"This is one great 70's movie. To answer some people's question of how Laura can all of a sudden see the murders,I read the book and she has or had a psychic connection to the killer since childhood,they probably should have had a scene to explain this. Anyway Faye is great,even when she is overacting,just 2 years later she'd ruin her movie career in Mommie Dearest. Great disco era songs,and a great Barbra Streisand theme song to boot.","8299":"Fashion and murder, like those Italian slasher flicks.  But instead of Goblin music, there's KC and the Sunshine Band!  Faye Dunaway's great as a prude who enjoys photographing beautiful people pretending to be dead.  Then they really start dying.","8301":"Incredible story based on the true life of two brothers approaching life in completely different ways.  The film is beautiful, tragic and life affirming all at once.  Brad Pitt is great as is Tom Skerritt as his father.  Had to go out and read the book afterwards.","8302":"I am a old fly fisherman of 79 years and the movie brought back old memories of my childhood.\nAt my age any thing that makes you think is great..","8303":"Good story with a young Brad Pitt. Great scenery Robert Redford at his best.. Keeps your interest throughout the movie.","8304":"Very good movie.  Of course anything directed by Clint Eastwood is good but I rate this one as excellent.  Sure you will enjoy it too.","8305":"great","8306":"A sweet romantic film.","8307":"Fun little movie always been one of my favorites.","8308":"One of the best feel good movies of all times","8309":"I really enjoyed the story and could see Robert Redfords style in it throughout.  What really sold me on this film, however, was the cinematography and the beautiful setting.  It made me want to go fly fishing!","8310":"This is a family movie.  How the family sticks together thru thick and thin.  The father Tom Skerritt is a preacher.\nBrad Pitt is out of control.  Gambling, bootlegging, etc.  The movie is really about the good and bad of things that go on through the families life.  Great movie.","8311":"Many years ago, I had a friend recommend this film to see but never got around to seeing it. Eventually, found an old copy on videodisc and watched it on my old RCA videodisc player. When it came out on DVD, I waited for a while since I had the old copy. Why did I wait?! The DVD restoration is crisp and clear with excellent video and sound. If you love scary\/thrillers and Faye Dunaway, I highly recommend this movie. Tommy Lee Jones does a great job too!!","8313":"I enjoyed it as much this time as I did back in the 70's when it was a cult film with my friends.  You know how sometimes you go back to something you loved as a teenager and find that it does not fill you with excitement like it did then?  Well this is not the case here.  Excellent and has some really interesting cast members who I didn't know back then such as Mr Addams from the Addams Family Movies and more. You'l love it.","8316":"I have fond memories of seeing this movie as a kid at the movie theater. I loved it then, and I happily found that I still love it over 30 years later. I was thrilled that my two kids enjoyed it, too! We were singing \"Hard Knock Life\" and \"Tomorrow\" for days. Well, at least I was. :)","8319":"Movie showed up in Great condition!! Disc plays perfectly and the movie is one of my favorites!! A Wonderful Classic!","8320":"Love this movie & Brad Pitt as well.  I've seen this film about a half dozen times and it never gets old.","8321":"Started to watch but, the movie was going nowhere so, I shut it off, so I guess you just be your own judge on this one. I didn't like it but, different strokes for different folks!","8322":"I LOVE this movie!","8323":"My eight yr old watched the new Annie movie and wanted to come home and watch the original and loved it!","8324":"Annie can eat a big brown bag of s***.","8325":"Brilliant history for Mon and Dad!","8326":"Great performance by all!  Enjoyed it so much!","8327":"good show","8328":"Not too good.","8329":"classic RDJ","8330":"Entertaining story of photographer Faye Dunaway as the title character, a photographer of models getting bumped off, who has visions of their murders as they happen.  Shocking climactic ending! Chilling!","8333":"Looking back this film made its mark in its day. It seems less a definitive stylistic thriller today since the impact upon its initial release. However, it is a great look at the not to distant past. This was an \"in\" film, a film you had to see. What I like about it is the location photography, production design and a young Tommy Lee Jones. Times have sure changed right before our eyes.","8337":"who doesn't love Annie!!?  It is a great musical.  Definitely a feel good movie.","8338":"Now ...this is the REAL Annie...we love this movie and would watch it over and over...soooo good and makes you want to sing over and over....","8339":"A well done rom-com with delightful leads.","8340":"are you frigging kidding me? You are charging for an almost 12 year old movie? I watched several times already. On netflix where you never have to pay twice. Unbelievable.","8341":"Fun little flick for a bit of Italian magic.  Lots of cliche moments, but it's fun if you're in the mood for a sweet romantic comedy.\nI appreciate that it's a clean film without sex, language or violence.\nCheers!","8345":"Dunaway gives one of her best performances here! Laura Mars is a fashion photog who is the toast of town with her 70's kitsch style glam shots. She also has the extraordinary ability to see through a serial killer's eyes! Tommy Lee Jones appears as a detective who falls for her. The film is pure camp and Dunaway chews the scenery as only she can. When her pal Donald bites it you can just feel the hilarity as she shreiks \"Donnnnnaaaaallllldddd!\" Do not pass this up!","8348":"Okay, you want a cheesed out supernatural thriller?  This is it!  And amazingly enough, it gets royal treatment on DVD without any of the VHS edits, a very clear picture, director's commentary, and even a commentary over the photo gallery that is just as informative.  The movie itself is a great social commentary on New York and advertising in the late 70s.  It's a little predictable, but completely entertaining.","8351":"They just don't make musicals like this any more!","8352":"Good movie","8353":"Love this movie","8354":"This one's really great - MUST SEE","8355":"Well written......and love the character that Marisa Tomei played","8356":"I love Marisa Tomei. She really makes this movie work. Very cute. Beautiful scenery.","8358":"Good movie with the little kids watching.","8359":"Great chemistry here!","8360":"The cutest movie! Marisa Tomei is darling and so unwavering on her beliefs, until the end. Robert Downey, Jr is a doll. I love Bonnie Hunt, how many wives know what she goes through and to be able to take that trip. Ahhhhh! The Italian man is so handsome. And Damon played by (?, I forget his name) is great. This is one of the movies I can run while doing chores, get into it and go away and come back. Too Cute, I love this movie!!","8361":"Good feel good movie, would recommend it for a date night or just to enjoy.","8362":"What I don't like is that I mistakenly ordered a VHS format which I cannot play. Have not been motivated to replace it with a DVD.","8364":"Excellent story set in a better time in America. The river still runs over the same rocks and will for many millennia. How we live our lives and the choices we make are the variables we often see too late.","8365":"This is such a beautiful movie! Especially if you ladies love Brad Pitt! The supporting cast is also great! The scenery is so good it almost steals the show!","8367":"This is one fine Movie. Its the Story of 2 brothers and the separate paths they take in Life. The lesson here is the Devil will get you if you don't watch out. You can't serve two masters everyone needs to make a choice.","8368":"This Movie Is In Some Parts A Heart Breaker, Won't Give Away The Plot But\nBrad Pitt Play An Excellent Part As Do The others.","8369":"Loved the movie when I was younger so wanted to watch it again. Love the scenery and love watching the fly fishing but it wasn't as good as I remembered it being.","8370":"Ok","8371":"I didn't care for the psychic portion of the movie, which was in the beginning, but otherwise I liked this movie a lot.","8372":"It was a fairly light entertaining film. I rented it for some views of Tuscany, but was disappointed about that.","8373":"This is one of the best movies ever made. If you love mountain streams, or fly fishing, or just love good drama and acting you'll love this movie. Redford is a great director and in this movie he's also a great narrator.","8374":"I,ve seem this movie three times. The story of two brothers & there minister father who teaches them fly fishing from childhood.\nThe HD was great. The Montana mountains are breathless. Brad Pitt steals the movie. Robert Redford is the director & also narrates it.","8375":"Lovely scenic scenes of Venice, Rome, the Amalfi Coast (Positano).\nThe Italian country side is a beautiful place to be stranded.\nThe acting is a treat, you will love it.","8376":"It was really sweet and good--nice for a late night surrounded by covers, cats and ice cream --I would recommend watching--but 2.99 is too high a price--however try to find it anywhere else","8377":"I choose this rating cuz well I love this movie of course because it has Robert downy jr in it but who does not like him. I would recommend this movie to everyone who loves Robert downy Jr.","8378":"Marisa Tomei is such a great actress....so good at portraying the main character as a self-absorbed and silly woman that the movie is at times hard to watch.  Great and attractive performances by Downey Jr, as always, and Bonnie Hunt is the saving grace!","8379":"Great movie! Always enjoyable to watch.","8380":"Sooo slow and tedious. I don't see all the hype for this one at all. Story is decent at best -- don't know what Redford was thinking; he's way better than this -- but the pace makes you want to just put a gun in your mouth.","8381":"Great film. The one that started it all for so many of these actors and solidified Robert Redford as a great director. Who knew Joseph Gordon-Levitt would become an actor, producer, and director as well. Amazing.","8382":"The movie description expected me to find a lot more adventure up in the wilderness, but instead dragged on and on. It wasn't till the last 1\/3 did I find it all coming together. Overall it was an excellent movie but I gave one star less than max due to the beginning of the movie.","8383":"One of the best movies of all times in my books.  I could watch it every day and never get tired of watching it.","8384":"Excellent","8385":"The premise, the acting, the extraordinary character of New York City, all keep the viewer fascinated","8386":"The first dvd of the fisher king  plays great on my dvd player. My friend could not play it on her dvd player so i kept i . Thanks it is good. From jenny.","8387":"It's a classic. No need to rate this movie!","8388":"Great!","8389":"This is one of my favorite movies. RIP Edward Herrmann (who played Franklin Roosevelt) who passed away on Wednesday, December 31, 2014.","8390":"I watched it three times the first week, and am ready to watch it a fourth time. Relaxing escape fare.","8394":"Excellent movie but very sad ending, & my daughter wad disappointed because there are no appearances by Redford (just narrated & directed by)","8395":"Tragic movie.  Moving because we can recognize one of our family members (or someone you may know) in at least one of the characters.","8396":"The Picture was well written and the Direction and acting were very good. Over all a very well made film.","8397":"Great Broadway musical with tons of choreography, however the plot is very predictable and did not explore the depths of many actor's characters.","8398":"I was disappointed. Nothing great like the original.","8402":"This movie is one of the unknown greats in my opinion....I love everything about this movie and am going my kids are old enough to enjoy it with me now!!!","8403":"Love Robin Williams!","8404":"Robin Williams does a wonderful acting job...as does Jeff Bridges.  Movie is somewhat \"off-center\" for Williams' usual style.  Excellent quality and delivery","8405":"The movie I always wanted and found a good price","8406":"Really a great story and movie.","8407":"Such a lovely tale.  The ballet is gorgeous, performances amazing all the way around!","8408":"An excellent film that was overlooked in its time.  I would say that this is one of Robin Williams' finest performances.  There is a lot going on in this movie and should be watched several times, at least.  Great cameo by Tom Waitts too.  Great acting overall, and great cinematography.\n\nThis is a serious, dramatic film, with humor mixed in.  This is a movie that should make you think and feel, and a must have in any film buffs collection.","8409":"Read the book years ago. Never wanted to watch the movie. Now I watched it and I'm kinda sorry I did.","8410":"View tips and guidelines  |  Headline & 20 more words required.

Did not like or finish.","8416":"I ordered this movie for a friend and her daughter enjoys it.","8417":"Just as listed......thanks","8418":"Very happy with my purchase and would purchase from again","8419":"Don't want refund  !  Thank You","8420":"Classic movie.  I cant believe it took me so long to buy this.  Glad I finally did","8421":"very moving film with a very beautiful ending. not brad pitt's best acting performance. slow at moments but worth finishing!","8423":"I found this film to be of quality and the story line very interesting, I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates films that are of quality, because there is so little of that in today's films.","8424":"This movie is a classic or should be . If you like fishing it's great .Brad Pitt at one of his best preformances .","8425":"Great movie!","8426":"Love this movie. Even better on Blu-Ray.","8427":"This is a well done movie with a great plot and storyline.  Of course, I always like movies produced, directed or starring Robert Redford.  He directed this one and the cast is outstanding.  Beautiful cinematography of Montana.","8428":"This movie just seemed like an average movie to me.  Frankly, I was yawning during most parts and mildly interested during a few.","8431":"Great show. Very unique.","8432":"Wonderful movie !","8433":"somewhat serious movie","8434":"As a career union (IATSE) projectionist who has viewed more movies than most, this film (after so many years) is still my #1 favorite after literally hundreds of viewings. Never fails to get the tears running and if you have an ounce of sensitivity in your soul, you will treasure this film forever.","8435":"One of my favorite movies of all time. Great acting, and directing. Could sit and watch this movie all afternoon.","8436":"This is a great movie and story. The cast is awesome. It will definitely draw some tears and stir up melancholic emotions. The narrative throughout the film completes the success.","8437":"Best Robin Williams movie ever, God rest his soul","8438":"One of my favorite character studies of all time.","8440":"Works well and no problems!","8441":"Great story of redemption","8442":"The movie is great.\nOne of the director's best.\nI've been searching for the bluray for years.\nThe result was a disaster.\nThe video is worse then the dvd.\nIt's nothing closer to sharp image.\nI have no idea how they name it a bluray.\nThe sound is HD all right but it cannot be forgiven because of the video quality.\nDo me a favor and just buy a dvd instead.","8443":"Classic","8444":"This will be another of my favorites. I like several of the actors, and they played their parts exceptionally well. People really lived these kinds of lifestyles, hard to believe nowadays but quite true. I've seen it three times in the last few years. It makes me wish I had lived in those days.\nIt's not often you get to see a movie like this that plays on so many of your emotions. And it doesn't require ultra sensational props to hold folk's attention. Quite well done in my opinion.","8446":"A family history at the turn of the century, when time moved slowly and family meant everything.  Great movie!  Can quote dialogue because I watch so much.","8447":"Good story, great actors.  I wanted to learn more about fly fishing.  This was not the movie for that.  Great Scenery, though","8448":"Another one of my all time favorite movies. The transformation of the brothers, from childhood to adulthood, is a marvel to watch.\nFrom the joy of their childhood, to the tragedy of their lives is stunning. This is a movie that brings me to tears every time I see it.\nIt is not often run on TV, and it is a must have for my small collection.","8449":"One of the best Bridges \/ William movies.","8450":"Blu-Ray. If you are reading this, you no doubt already know whats going on here and I will leave the minutia to other reviewers and give no spoilers here. My short version is this. Performances: Oscar caliber. BD Disc: looks pretty decent. Movie itself: captivating yet disturbing. After watching this I felt exhausted and a little bit beat up, if you can understand what I mean. If you like movies for the art form as I do, definitely check this one out.","8451":"This was one of Robin Williams's best movies. It's often overlooked.","8452":"Excellent product!","8453":"Great movie, good price","8454":"Cute kids musical!","8455":"Always good fun to introduce to the kids","8456":"Annie says it was worth five Stars. Who am I to quibble? I wasn't the one who saw it she was. So that's her rating. I suspect a little name bias but how can you prove it?","8457":"This was enjoyable to watch again after all of these years.  Pitt really plays those rebellious, wild child parts well.  I love this movie.  Good narration too.","8458":"This film and \"Horse Whisperer\" are the only two Redford films I really like, I guess because they revert to a long gone time in film making.  No endless sex, violence, and things blowing up. No one is making movies like this anymore.  Not even Redford.  Entertaining story and good acting by all the players in this movie.","8459":"I am satisfy and happy with the purchase of this dvd... i bought it for a gift ..the person is very happy...great quality and condition i will buy from this seller again..","8460":"This movie is a hymn to God's beautiful creation, exemplified by the glories of Montana scenery; and all wrapped around a good story. There is the good son\/black-sheep son element, strict but loving parents and an enduring love interest. One of director Redford's best. He was a great actor but an even better director. Blu-Ray brings out the best.","8461":"Singing is great, everyone should see this version just to see Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan.","8463":"For 2 hours, absolutely nothing happens, nothing.  Then the movie ends.  This is absolutely one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, and I've seen some boring movies.","8464":"I first saw this film not long after a very close person to me had passed away, it could have been prevented. This is a most beautiful film, it is  story of a man looking back on his life and the love and bond he had with his brother. Some parts are hilariously funny, the ending had me in tears. I can't recommend this movie highly enough, you have to see it. \"Now, nearly all those I loved and did not understand in my youth are dead, even Jessie. But I still reach out to them...\"","8465":"\"In our family there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing...\"  Brilliant.  I have long been a fan of Maclean's novella, and the footage of western Montana is magnificent.","8466":"one of the best movies both actors have done.  I had this in vcr and wanted to update it to dvd as I enjoy watching it again and again.","8467":"Great film. Good delivery","8468":"a nice look at how words can indeed hurt people.","8469":"THANK YOU!","8470":"This movie is visually and inspirationally worth anyone's time.  I had been looking to replace my vhs copy and glad I found this deal.","8471":"happy wife happy life\ni think silly to need so many words for a review):\nfive more words. lol Zzz","8473":"I loved this movie! Great for the whole family!","8474":"I loved this movie. Great to watch with the family. Movie leaves you feeling like you can love everybody.","8475":"saw it as a kid, the plot is thin but the songs are great, fun to be able to watch it again.","8476":"One of the best classics I've seen. Its message transcends time & trends.","8477":"awesome movie very moving sad funny etc. loved it","8478":"I consider this Robin Williams best movie","8479":"OMG loved this movie","8480":"This movie really surprised me... it showcases what can happen when a person faces a great tragedy and how it affects the pysche. Its also a great story about love and friendship. Of course Robin Williams is brilliant in this role playing a man that is mentally disturbed by his wife's murder and eventually ends up in a catatonic state.","8481":"Loved the movie when it came out when I was a kid. Great story.","8482":"Watch it whenever I'm lonely and it brightens me up!","8483":"I really loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. It came before the date required and in the quality stated.","8484":"Have loved this movie for years so decided to get it in Blu-ray.  Has so much more depth.  Very good story.","8486":"Loved this movie very good and inspirational would highly recommend it loved it well worth the purchased be your own judge and give it a shot","8487":"Never saw this before.  Outstanding acting and performance by two of the best.","8488":"Almost couldn't watch it as the pain of losing Robin Williams is still fresh but it is his absolute best performance so I did.  I hadn't seen it in years and had forgotten how beautiful a film it is.  A thinking person's film full of rich character development, it stands as a lesson in humanity.  I adore Terry Gilliam's films but if he had to stake his reputation on only one of them, this would be the one I would pick.  5 Stars doesn't even begin to touch it.","8489":"excellent","8490":"Fantastic movie! Loved it!","8491":"The best.","8493":"Happy with the smooth transaction. Glad to have this OOP blu-ray book edition. The supplements are well worth it in addition to the well paced, stunningly beautiful movie.","8494":"This is a wonderful story of two boys growing into manhood in the early nineteen hundreds in Missoula Montana.  Robert Redford's narrations adds volumes to the understanding of the story.","8496":"my mother loved it,very good story .\nIm so lucky to be on Amazon,they are always\nso helpful and to navigate the site is very simple\none very happy customer.","8498":"Brilliant.  Watch it over and over if only to be reminded of the three essentials of life. And Amanda Plummer. And Michael Jeter for one of the funniest 5 minutes in any movie. A little like black licorice; not for everyone. But if you like it,  you probably really like it.","8499":"this DVD will not play in my brand new DVD player ? !! it's is not a Blue Ray\nmy other DVDs work - I need to have this replaced !","8500":"A classic. Every moment of it is perfect. The chemistry between the two great actors is pure magic. The wonderful weirdness of NYC is lovingly captured.","8501":"Good story. Good acting. Good movie","8502":"I love Annie this one is my fav it's hard to believe this one is there 30th Anniv. Good family movie","8503":"well done","8504":"Another good movie","8505":"This movie is startling, in that is also about an event that separates one man from the rest of his life.\nRobin William and Jeff Bridges are both amazing in this movie, as is Mercedes Rhuel.","8506":"An incredible movie...one of my all-time favorites, and I don't say that lightly...","8507":"Item delivered on time, was as described","8508":"Excellent!","8509":"One of my favorite movies!","8510":"bleak, sick unhappy characters... bleghhh...","8511":"I haven't seen Annie since its theatrical release in nineteen-eighty-something. I was too young then (and not at all into musicals) to appreciate the film at the time. It's a classic and I'd recommend it as a wholesome, family-friendly feel-good movie.","8512":"The movie is terrific fun and I really enjoyed it after not having seen it for several years.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was the sound quality. I listened to the movie through Amazon Instant Video on my new iPad and the sound was terrible! I attempted several adjustments to no avail.  Another instant video with music had great sound.","8513":"Classic!","8514":"beautiful nature - the movie is just ok - wouldn't recommend it - pretty boring at times - had to fast forward it.","8515":"One of Brad Pitts finest works.  I have seen this movie multiple times, and read the book.  A true piece of artistry.  Anyone this good should not let that talent go to waste.","8516":"This is a beautiful movie.  The cinematography, which features rural Montana, is beautiful; and the way in which the plot is portrayed is also beautiful.  This film has touched my heart for years.  The movie varies somewhat from the original novella written by Norman Maclean, but there are several memorable passages from the book incorporated into the script.  Regardless, the movie is wonderful and the experience of enjoying it has been improved by having it issued on Blu Ray.","8517":"Thank you so very much for this great movie; I love it!  I will be sharing it with my friends.","8518":"excellent movie,well directed,written..and well acted. Brad Pitt's performance was excellent. I could not believe the stunning picturesque backgrounds and photography in this film. Makes you want to Tour this country !","8519":"one of my essential films. the scene at the chinese restaurant between robin williams and amanda plummer is worth the entire price of admission. improvisation at its best. hilarious.","8520":"good","8521":"Jeff Bridges & Robin Williams are hysterical magnets in kind. The under-lying story is one of strong emotion & trauma; but with the supporting cast it pulls off a hilarity that ends with such a release of happiness & recovery for Williams & Bridges","8522":"Very good, one of the best.","8523":"Fun","8524":"love this film","8525":"Two thumbs up.","8526":"Not never gets old!  Great story!","8527":"LOVE AND ENJOYED IT  TELL OTHERS TO WATCH TOOOOOOOOOOO","8528":"I should have read the bad reviews before watching this over-long, misadventure in film-making.  I have to agree with ALL the one-star reviews here.  I am glad I saw this mess on TV before buying the DVD.  It is highly offensive to anyone not saturated in liberalism with perverted views of religion and art.  This crap is pointless, obtuse, and degrading to the kind of people who live in Montana, none of whom appear in this movie.","8532":"Great  movie play","8533":"Robin Williams! 'Nuff said!!!","8534":"I can't comment as I bought this as a gift.","8535":"Excellent!","8540":"One of the most beautiful films I've seen in my life. The natural scenery of Montana is sublime!","8541":"This is one of the best movies about growing up in a challenging natural world.","8542":"Set in Montana between 1910 and 1935, the story reflects on the communication gap between two brothers and their minister father, all of whom love fly-fishing. I think this is one of the most visually beautiful movies to stream across the screen in a long time. A simple and powerful movie and a timeless tail that speaks to everyone.","8543":"A classic the whole family can enjoy. Great movie awesome storyline.","8544":"Great brings back the memory's from childhood!!!","8545":"To weird for me.  Didn't understand most of it.","8546":"One of Robin Williams' classic performances!  Not to mention Jeff Bridges who is also awesome in this!  Hadn't seen this since it was in the theaters and it was well worth rewatching!","8547":"The young folk might find this movie too slow moving for them. However, anyone who appreciates the people of the greatest generation will enjoy the deep reaching relationships in this film. I'm glad I have it in my movie library. It's worth watching again.","8552":"Annie is such a great feel good family movie. The vocals are amazing in this and the movie is just as I remembered it when I went to see it in theaters as a child. My kids love it as well. You'll be singing \"Tomorrow\" for weeks;)","8554":"Outstanding movie, and acting.  Watch it over and over again.  Too bad it spawned so many idiot \"wannabes\" to pick up a fly rod and clog the riverbanks.","8555":"Great movie!\n\nOne of Brad Pitt's many, many great movies!\n\nA great story with great characters!\n\nIf by some chance, you haven't seen it, watch it!!","8556":"Add this one to your library. Beautiful scenery, great story and great acting make this film a personal library keeper. This flim clearly showcases two things; namely, Robert Redfords directing genius and Brad Pitts acting depth. I think in many respects A River.... parallels Ordinary People in character, depth and scope.","8557":"Great story of redemption ... funny and touching.  A modern day search for the Holy Grail.  It's in the top five of my desert island classics.  I never tire of this story.","8558":"Terry Gilliam is a brilliant director. This movie works on many levels.","8559":"This is great and i am hard to please","8560":"Hang on to your heart strings folks  ,,","8561":"Robin williams should have received an OSCAR for his performance!","8563":"A movie that had no popular resonance but exemplified the beauty of water, trout, family, the sun, and the richness of life yet unexplored. We are a dying species, this film perhaps captures a few of us who perceive the transience of life and the beauty of seeing into the moment.\n\nThe photography is a wonder, the theme is unique, the message is universal.","8565":"This 1992 movie has a star-studded cast (Brad Pitt, Tom Skerritt) and is a great period piece based on Norman Maclean's autobiography of the same name. Great cinematography, with a meandering story line (to follow the river I'm sure). An overall \"nice\" film - not hard to watch, but not hard to skip either.","8566":"dude","8567":"it had been years since i watched Robin in this movie!!! it is funny and heartbreaking to watch him knowing he is not longer with us!","8568":"This was a awesome movie I bought it for a friend because I knew that he loved it.","8569":"wife loves this movie","8570":"Product as stated. Very pleased.","8573":"I was not too crazy about the plot or the subject, but I gave this movie 4 stars because the execution was impeccable.  This whole idea of Prodigal Son has been done to death.  There is just so much of Biblical allusions and sugary Norman Rockwell nostlagia that you can take in one seating.  It's really a challenge for the director to take an overprocessed idea and present it in an interesting fashion.  The photography and the costumes kept me stimulated.","8579":"Good family show. My daughter loved it.","8586":"Enjoyed this a second time, after seeing it years ago in the cinema.  Hard to watch though, now knowing of his great, hidden suffering.","8587":"One of my favorites, and was happy to see it on Amazon.  Lots of meaning of the effect of loss, the interconnectedness among all of us, and even the usefulness of insanity.  Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges were great.","8588":"Strangely moving dream-like film.  It's right up there with the Cohen Brothers material...","8589":"excellent","8590":"Annie","8591":"It was a very good deal for what I spent!","8593":"Robert Redford has done it again. hes made a movie so memorable that it is great. with a cast like this it makes the film worth while. Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt are brothers, Pitt is the wild one and they have a priest father played awesomely by Tom Skeritt. full of powerful scenes and the tear jereker for some girls when the shocking news of their beloved Brad Pitt dieing","8594":"A truly memorable film featuring superb direction, acting, and writing.  Redford, the film's director, also is its narrator and does a wonderfully at both jobs!\nHighly recommended.","8598":"Good","8599":"Wonderful.","8600":"Pretty good movie.  A little long but good acting and happy ending.","8601":"Great movie. This is likely R. Williams best!  This flicks shows his diversity in acting.  I always feel, when I watch him in a zany scene, that he is just letting it all out.  You won't want to miss this one.","8604":"The original short story is a better story, but I am an unabashed fan of watching the fly fishing and seeing the beautiful mountain scenery in this visually gorgeous film.\nBrad Pitt shows real acting genius in this one, too.","8607":"Great movie for my four and seven year old girls.  Excitement, drama, kid-centric - they've enjoyed watching it.","8608":"Superbly photography and an unbelievable score do (believe it or not) compensate for a predictable and overlong story. It's still fairly entertaining however and beautiful to look at, with all actors at the top of their form. Good family viewing. Just don't look for originality or much depth.","8609":"The river runs between two brothers (Craig Sheffer and Brad Pitt), it runs through their very different lifestyles.  Through fly-fishing their father (Tom Skeritt) taught them the fundamental principles of life.\nBeautiful cinematography is the real star of this adaptaion of Norman MacLean's novel.  Another bullseye by Redford as a director; his direction gives the movie a poetic feeling from the very beginning.  Unforgettable.","8611":"Robert Redford has a way of making the written word come to life on screen.  He did it with Ordinary People and he repeated it with \"River\"\nThe scenery in this movie is breathtaking.  It sets the tone for the whole movie.\nThe acting, as well, is top-notch.  In my opinion this is Brad Pitt's finest hour.  Before he became the heartthrob he is today - which often brings out bad movies by the dozen - he excells as the rebellious Paul Mclean.\nThis movie will touch your soul.","8612":"There are few movies that I'm willing to purchase, only those that I enjoy seeing again and again. This is without a doubt one of those films. Brad Pitt, Craig Sheffer, Tom Skeritt, Emily Lloyd et al, all gave fine performaces. Redford's narration of a great Norman Maclean novel and the scenic Montana views added immeasurably to my enjoyment of this film. This is one for folks of all ages!","8613":"ok movie. A bit strange at times.","8614":"Wonderful movie with wonderful comedian!","8615":"Thank you very much for getting this to me so quickly. I'm going to have a Robin Williams Day after the first of the years and catch all his movies. Your promptness is greatly appreciated. I look forward to seeing it.","8616":"Trying to gather up a collection of the Robin Williams movies.  This is but one of over a dozen I have gotten since his death.","8617":"great condition great movie","8618":"Gift for Christmas that was on a list.","8619":"It's still a great movie with a great cast.","8620":"A filthy movie.  Makes me feel like I need a bath and then another bath.","8621":"Such drama and amazing","8622":"Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams are great in this move.","8623":"Got a few R Williams movies after his tragic suicide--Loved it when I saw it and time hasn't dimmed teh virtuoso performances--Terry Gilliam was and is a visionary director.","8624":"A different view of Robin Williams. Kinda Weird.","8625":"it was ok and on time","8626":"I loved this movie when it came out in theaters. I saw it multiple times & knew all the songs. Nostalgic.","8627":"Just a little cheesie.","8628":"nan","8629":"Such a great performance from all the cast!","8630":"I admired Robin Williams but I did not like all of his shows or movies.  This movie was wacky and I just could not get into it.  It is also a little bit raunchy--I am not a prude but this was a little much.  Most of all the plot was too weird for me.","8631":"If you haven't seen this Robin Williams, you've really missed out! Another DVD on the forever shelf...","8632":"super movie","8633":"Liked this movie a lot.  A little strange at time compared to our usual movies but really liked this one.  Good acting and deeper than it seems.","8634":"arrived perfect","8635":"It's the original Annie it's a classic all four of my children loved it! Girls and Boys alike","8636":"Great fun and heart warming movie.  All the singing and dancing is wonderful.  My 5 year old daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed it!","8637":"Still makes me laugh and cry and sing along!","8638":"A+++service","8639":"Well done and pretty entertaining, but be warned that there is alot of the \"F\" word. I only ordered it because of the late, great Robin Williams, but did get involved in the story. Done very well in my opinion. I wouldn't watch it with children, but worth watching.","8640":"love it","8641":"Very good","8642":"Great movie I justvwanted the flick on dvd.\nRobin Williams earned an Oscar nomination and Jeff Bridgesgive Oscar worthy performances and Bridges girl friend won the Oscar.","8643":"This is a great musical for the whole family!  Really catchy songs that are better than any sampled rap that came after.  The little kids are amazing acrobats and the adult characters have some great lines and prove to be not exactly pure evil.","8644":"I lived it when I saw it in the theater as a kid and loved watching it at home with my kid.\nHats off to the late John Huston for making a film that the whole family really can enjoy.","8645":"Did Robin Williams do anything that wasn't worth watching","8646":"Good movie.","8647":"brilliant.\nRobin Williams and Terry Gillian at their best.","8649":"Personally think this is one of Robins best movies ever.","8650":"Best film I have seen in a long time. The interwoven stories of all the cast makes you wish it would never end.","8651":"One of Robin Williams' best movies of all time.","8652":"Awesome","8653":"great","8654":"Great Movie! Funny and well acted. Great score too!","8655":"A very inspiring old Movie. All Kids should see it?","8656":"My 7 year old loves it!","8657":"Great family film.","8658":"We thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this movie.  Music and all it was a good evening's entertainment.","8659":"Another Robin Williams addiition to my collection.","8660":"Cute movie for a really reasonable price...","8661":"terrible so sorry Robin William's was in it","8662":"Excellent movie must watch. Great acting!","8664":"The waltzing scene in Grand Central is a classic.  So much to love about this movie.","8665":"perfect","8666":"Great family show, love the original Annie not all the remakes.","8667":"Come on everyone, this is a good movie and doesn't deserve the bad rap.  If the broadway musical hadn't raised the bar to unattainable heights, this movie would have made lots of money in the box office. There is a small consolation, I believe the VHS, DVD and Blu-Ray versions helped Columbia\/Rastar (or someone) make some money.  If you have the presence of mind to set-aside the stage version, take a couple of hours and enjoy the last of the big-budget musicals!","8668":"Love this classic movie!  The casting here is perfect!  Aileen Quinn is superb as Annie!  She's the original comic strip come to life and so adorable!  Carol Burnett, Albert Finney and Geoffrey Holder give magnificent performances as well.  Truly the best cast ever assembled for an Annie production.  Great music and amazing choreography too.  Wonderful family film and faithful to the original comics.","8669":"Excellent!","8671":"Great Film That Shows The Range That Both Actors Display During This Film.","8672":"Who doesn't love Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams is, as usual, fantastic in this movie. He will be missed! This movie is dark and funny and the characters are great. I re-watch this one time and again and its still very poignant.","8674":"Great movie!!","8675":"The Fisher King on VHS Arrived 2-4 days after I placed my order. Very Powerful movie w\/ a very detailed story, probably have to watch it a second time, Great Movie!\n\nR.I.P. Robin Williams: :(","8676":"Really like Robin Williams I think he's real funny guy but he is a really dramatic role in this movie.","8677":"Using my Gramp`s account. I watched this on Netflix. GREAT MOVIE! I loved this movie! Very sad and dramatic at the same time. Great movie for families, however there is some language that maybe parents don`t want their children hearing. There is tons of songs such as, It`s A Hard Knock Life and The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow. If you are not subscribed to Netflix and want to see this movie, I recommend buying this on DVD from Amazon.","8678":"This is one of my favorite all time movies. Carol Burnett is a comedic genius.","8679":"One of my favorites by Robin Williams","8680":"One of Robin Williams's finest films with a great compliment of costars. A little dark for some folks although a masterpiece none the less.","8681":"Jeff Bridges and Robbin Williams are great together.","8682":"A precursor of Terry Gilliam's twelve Monkeys. Fantastic cast with signs of brilliance from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges. What happened to Mercedes Ruehl. Too many years since we've seen her in anything.","8683":"Excellent item, highly satisfied","8684":"I watch this classic with my 3 year old over the weekend & she loved it.","8685":"Truly a classic!  The story is excellent and somehow manages to serious and funny at the same time.  The music is excellent as well and comes at just the right moment to reinforce the emotions invoke by this classic story.","8687":"HEAVEN WILL BE A FUNNIER PLACE NOW.","8688":"I'm not normally interested in romantic comedies, but in the end it's hard to place any of Gilliam's movies into a single genre. The Fisher King is a strange, touching, and hilarious adventure about loss and redemption. It's hard to describe it in further detail in a way that would do the film justice, so all I can say is treat yourself to a viewing.","8689":"Very moving tale, excellently produced & acted.  One of my all-time favorite movies.","8690":"Nice remake of a classic!","8691":"love it","8692":"Okay movie for family viewing.","8693":"very cheerful, optimistic, and overall great movie","8694":"A wonderful classic!","8698":"Ever since I found out Terry Gilliam directed this movie I've been meaning to check it out. I finally bought it, watched it, and dug it. It's very Terry Gilliam-esque which, depending on your opinions on the director, may be good or bad.","8699":"Already left a review of this item. Love this item. Please don't force your customers to write more than they want just to fill a word quota. It is very annoying.","8700":"A 1991 masterpiece compliments of Terry Gilliam. I love film and I've enjoyed this one no less than ten times. Normally, after one or two viewings, I become bored...the outcome known. This film...stands above the rest. I dare anyone to watch this film but one time. The cast is stellar, the story untouchable, this film's soulful impact undeniable.","8701":"Fisher King is a wonderful about a man who has to learn to give to others before himself.  One of my favorite performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges.","8702":"Bridges & Williams - great actors and this story can be timely in any decade but it is a bit long and the anguish of both characters suffering thru their arcs is well acted but takes patience. Would recommend.","8703":"I remember being a kid, and this, one of many, being one of my FAVES. I'd sit on my front porch step, playing in the water hose, singing all the songs!!","8704":"Great family musical to watch. My daughter really enjoyed this one.","8705":"It's just a feel god movie","8706":"You have to love Robin Williams in this. Jeff is great too. But Robin is the man! Get it now!","8707":"Always liked this movie, finally got around to buying it.  Good quality, plays good, no complaints. Enjoyed seeing it again.","8708":"Excellent movie. Best yet.  Have always loved movies and music. This is the best!\nThanks You always for giving me this.","8711":"Very good movie. One of my favorites...kind of like \"one flew over the CooCoo's nest\" soft of movie. Leaves you feeling good at the end. :)","8713":"Great Classic Movie!! My niece is actually the one who watched it but this was one of my fav's as a child!!","8714":"Great little movie","8715":"Classic","8716":"Here is another Williams performance that is wonderful.  Jeff Bridges does a great job also and the pair make a wonderful movie. Interesting plot.","8717":"I've seen better movies with these actors. The best part was the park scene, other than that it was slow, a guy down on his luck.","8718":"It is an ok movie.  The problem with this movie is its too long.  The movie could have been cut by at least 45 min.  You learn about the main characters too many times - once is enough.  If you have 2 hours and 17 min to kill then watch the movie.","8719":"This is an interesting flick about a Harvard professor who becomes an alternate personality in a quest not only for  the Grail but for real love. Overall a cute flick.","8720":"I wasn't sure what to expect here - and it had a bit of a slow start, but I found myself intrigued and involved in the story to the very end. It may require a bit of patience - but definitely worth watching.","8721":"I like the singing and humor of this movie.","8722":"Although this video was made several years ago, my 5 and 7 year old grandchildren loved it. I also found it very entertaining and well done.","8723":"Annie is always a cute show you just can't go wrong with\nAnnie. Good family show and great musical.","8724":"This movie is so wonderful.","8725":"You would think this would be a great choice for a family movie night but I wouldn't call it a family friendly version of the play. The acting and musical numbers are excellent, but if you are hesitant to entertain your children with drunken and often lewd characters, I would suggest you choose something different. There was a more recent remake  starring Victor Garber, Alan Cummings etc. which was a much more appropriate telling.","8726":"A good movie for all ages.","8727":"Great movie musical. A good reminder of the old days of Little Orphan Annie and Daddy Warlocks. Never get tired of watching it.","8728":"Great movie","8729":"I was expecting great things.  If I'd just stumbled onto this movie, knowing nothing in advance, I'd possibly thought it worth five stars, but it didn't live up to (possibly impossible) expectations.","8730":"great movie","8731":"Classic","8732":"I had seen this movie years ago and it left a big impact on my mind. I couldn't remember all of it and after I saw it again I realized why. The plot, the acting, and everything else are suburbly done.","8734":"An underappreciated gem, full of great actors & plot twists, with a lesson in life and love that is timeless and touching, all set against the crazy asylum that is NYC....","8735":"Love it very great movie.","8737":"Wonderful and light hearted film.  It is full of great music that is familiar to most of us.  All actors are especially well suited to their parts and it is one of Carol Burnett's finest performances.","8738":"I always love a classic :)","8739":"wonderful and sweet, i love annie","8740":"As a Christian I must object to the promiscuous and major alcoholic behavior of the orphanage lady played by Carol Burnett. Her character in this movie is not appropriate to show little kids that are very impressionable. There is also a cuss word that really upset me. The name of the Lord is taken in vain in the disgusting G-D slang word at the end as well. I wouldn't recommend to any Christian family.","8741":"Great classic family musical.","8742":"My husband couldn't handle the singing...which it was a musical.","8743":"My 4 year old just watched this for the first time. Some things are over her head but for the most part she seemed to enjoy it.","8745":"I really am a big fan of Robin Williams. It is rather strange but entertaining to watch. It does have some crude seens that are rather nuts but I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend this to any Williams fan.","8746":"...the service was very good.\n\nI don't know what she thought of the movie.\n\nI have seen it before and think it is Robin Williams best performance in anything.","8747":"Who could ask for more.  Robing Williams and Jeff Bridges.  2 excellent actors and a wonderful story with  a good supporting cast.","8748":"Amazing performances, poignant yet funny, a human story of unlikely relationships, redemption, and  transformation.  I am a Robin Williams fan and he shines in this movie, just brilliant.","8750":"Finally, I have been lookng for this since I was a kid.  Great movie.  I hope the one that is released in December with Jamie Foxx is just as good.","8751":"Classic!","8752":"Wonderful wonderful movie! Robin Williams in a more serious role and Jeff Bridges make an amazing performance that is not to be missed!","8754":"Awesome movie and it looks great kn bluray. The seller was super quick and it was packaged great. I've seen the movie several times but watching it on bluray was brest\nthanks sgain","8756":"Wasn't in the mood for so much singing and so less dialogue","8757":"I'm sure this version is \"Far superior \" to the one being released this Christmas.  Still a little \"dark\" but that's John Huston 's style.  Nothing tops seeing the play... but this is your 2nd alternative that is best!","8758":"I love this movie and enjoyed a lot.  I like Annie, even thou is an orphanage little girl, she is very sweet with an unique tough and funny character.","8759":"Good movie, great songs!","8760":"Another fine musical.  I hope that all kids get the opportunity to view this film.","8761":"This movie was always a favorite of mine. Good family entertainment. Shipping was fast and packaging was great.","8762":"This is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite of Terry Gilliam's. That is the reason I was very disappointed in this Blu Ray release that is nothing but a straight transfer from DVD at best with no extras whatsoever. Wait for a decent release. I would give it one star, but I actually love this movie and couldn't bring myself to do it....","8763":"It always amazes me how well Robin Williams does in serious roles (I think he does better than his 'funny' roles). The team of Williams and Jeff Bridges shine, with each character playing off the other throughout the movie. The overall message of the movie: we all have something to overcome. This is something we can all relate to, which makes the movie as good as it is. Like the title says, a hidden gem from 1991.","8764":"Pretty good movie...let's face it Robin Williams is a comedic geneous and his serious moments on film are OK too.","8765":"I have the Israeli dvd of this, so I don't know if the dvd sold here is all Hebrew or not.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice dvd for preschoolers, this one is great!  Short dialogue scenes are interspersed with some great kids' songs.  My 3 year old now can't decide between Dudu or Uncle Moishy!  The dialogue is slower paced than the Rehov Sumsum dvds, so a bit easier to follow for non-ivrit speaking parents.","8769":"How can you not like it!  Its a fantastic classic, even with the slightly racist overtones in some of the characters.  I was slightly shocked to not have remembered that there were a few choice words I would have preferred my six year old not overhear, but then again, there are worse movies to which he would be exposed.  The songs are still wonderful and aside from not fitting in to the politically correct mold movies currently are, the movie still transcends time well.","8770":"good movie.  Great music","8771":"My kids love this classic movie!","8775":"A strangley realistic seeming film because it involves homeless and poor people and psychology yet includes the wondrous element of hope. Great flick.","8777":"This movie is amazing.  Don't sit there wondering if you should watch it, trust me on this one.  It starts out fast, keeps running the whole movie.  Robin Williams deserved every award for his acting, he will make you cry, laugh, think.  I don't know what else came out at the same time, but Fisher King was better.  Totally worth a look.","8778":"great movie, I miss how every movie from the mid 80s and before had people that had talent in them. Remember when there was no such thing as a movie that did not have singing in it? or playing musical instruments? every girl in this movie has a phenomenal voice and can also act amazing. I bought this to see if my 3 year old would watch it since she only watches Dora now, and now this is one of her favorites.","8779":"Great movie  ! Timeless in theme and music is fantastic.","8780":"Ok","8781":"I've always loved this movie and finally got it on DVD.  There's maybe not a complex plot, however it's full of quirky characters that are somehow likable. Robin Williams is fabulous as a former college professor and Jeff Bridges as a former Shock-Jock who have crossed paths.  There is of course a dark undertone to keep one interested.\nAll in all a fun, believable movie, although it's probably not for everyone.","8783":"Phenomenal movie.  Why Terry Gilliam is one of the finest filmmakers ever.  If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor.  Micheal Jeter also deserves complete respect for his performance as well.  Did you see Tom Waits?  BOOP! Go No Further!","8784":"THe movie is wonderfully Acted and very meaningful. It Shows the ups and downs of everyday life. I would highly Recommand buying this movie","8787":"Really need to see this great movie. Rated R for language and violence.","8788":"This is the original and it is very good.  However the 1999 Disney version is just as good if not better in some areas.  The famous music that made this show so good is used more often in the Disney version and  I like the  dancing  better.  The Disney version is faster moving for today's younger kids.  Both shows are great.","8789":"This was a gift and it was loved by the 8 yr. old recipient.","8798":"Annie has always been a favorite of mine. I've always wanted a \"hard knock life\" so I could sing my blues away. As an adult now, bills are about as hard knocked as I'll appreciate. Share with your children, friends and family for that good ol' story of finding your place in hard times.","8799":"I love the story and the music, but the misuse of God's Name stops me from purchasing the movie.","8800":"Awesome transaction. A+","8804":"this is one of my all time favorites, for so many reasons. Robin Williams gives an amazing performance. Mercedes Ruehl has many of the best lines in the film-an awesome actress. i could watch Michael Jeter singing to Amanda Plummer a million times and never grow tired of it-he steals the whole movie with this one scene! so much of the dialogue is touchingly funny and sweet.i also love the music used in the movie.this is a great film,with great performances; i love it.","8809":"Always entertaining.  Well casted and well performed","8810":"enjoyed it","8811":"my great granddaughters favorite, so i purchased it for her as a gift for her birthday","8812":"All time family favorite!","8813":"I always liked this movie","8814":"Could do without the drunkenness, smoking, and impropriety.","8821":"This is the best movie I saw in a few months. Stunning. I don't want to spoil it to you, so no details. But it's touching enough to be a date-kind of flick. It's mood changes and characters are deep and believable. The movie deals with murder, suicide, loss of beloved, madness, self-centeredness and still manages to be funny, entertaining and feel-good movie after all. Brilliant.","8822":"So happy I bought this movie my kids love it and so do I.","8823":"Awesome! :)","8825":"enjoyable movie","8826":"Even bought the soundtrack!","8832":"This is a wonderful film, with Robin Williams putting in what I consider his finest performance.  It is also quite a different film - the sets are almost surreal, while showing the plight of homeless people in a stark and  uncompromising light.  But most of all it is a film that will make you  laugh, and make you cry, and I feel you can never want more from  entertainment than that.  Don't pass it by - it is truly a wonderful film  about how you can find salvation in the most unlikely of places.","8833":"Good","8834":"A long time favorite for the whole family.","8835":"NICE","8836":"Love the movie the songs, along with the choreograph","8837":"My daughter watched this everyday of her life when she was 5-6...Still loves it at 31. This was a replacement for the one of hers I loaned out and never received back. Arrived when expected.","8838":"I remember watching this as a kid - and liked it a lot.  I don't think my 5 year old boy liked it quite as much as me :(","8839":"Love it. Thanks for your service.","8840":"Item arrived on time and as described, very pleased with the seller and the item.","8841":"As advertised","8842":"The very best Annie, ever.  Songs, character actors wonderful songs and dancing children and of course, Carol Burnett.  One of my favorite songs from the show was \"Won't you be my baby\".  Love the whole story.","8843":"Old time favorite. Good timing.","8844":"My brother loves it and watches it everyday.","8845":"good movie","8846":"Great movie","8847":"Not really my kind of movie. I think it is probably a great stage play, but I was a bit disappointed. Having said all that, it was well done, but again, it seemed, all the while, as though I should be seeing it on stage.","8848":"Fun movie for adults and children. Have watched it many times","8849":"You can't go wrong with this one-- the movie quality was pretty good and it's just fun to sing along with.","8850":"good movie","8851":"My Daughter and Granddaughter Love this movie!","8852":"We showed this old classic to young kids and it held their attention. There is nothing offensive in the content  and many adults will like the story.","8854":"This is a story that never grows old. I purchased it for the children in my life but totally enjoy it myself. I have seen it many times and still enjoy it very much. Highly recommend this movie.","8855":"There is a new version of Annie coming out later in 2014, but I wanted my 13 year old daughter to see the old version first.  This version is really just a movie re-creation of the stage play.  The little girl who plays Annie is adorable and the rest of the cast is OK.  Carol Burnett is hilarious as a drunken, bitter old lady who runs a girls school and doesn't find her heart til near the end of the movie.  If you like musicals, you will love Annie.","8856":"My favorite movie of all times!!! Love the Blu-ray format. The extras are cool, the colors amazing and so worth the money!","8857":"Great Item - Love It - Would recommend highly.","8858":"I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! IT HAS AN AMAZING CAST. THE SONGS WILL PLAY IN YOUR HEAD ALL DAY. YOU MUST SEEE THIS MOVIE","8859":"The one major downside to buying this for the kids was the fact that I am now hearing the songs every day... I mean EVERY DAY!!\n\nOn the plus side they really enjoyed it.","8860":"I cannot get enough of this movie.  I watched it whenever I could as a kid and purchased it for my daughter who now loves it as well.  It's difficult to find movies for her because she doesn't like scary scenes.  The climax of this movie is just enough excitement without taking it too far.","8861":"Anyone who hasn't watched Annie, whether it be at the theatre or movie theatre, needs to see it immediately. It's a classic with some of the most memorable music I've ever heard!","8862":"Pretty decent film version of the Broadway hit musical.  My oldest daughter fell in love with it as a little girl, now her little girl is loving it.  A timeless classic.","8863":"To compare this to other musicals like Singing in the Rain really makes this pathetic.\n\nAlbert Finney is horrible.  He seemed to hate acting in the movie almost as much as I hated watching him act in it.\n\nThe performances were so stiff.","8864":"Annie is a classic. A great family movie. I loved sharing this movie with my family and friends. Oldie but a goodie","8865":"We were blown away by this bluray version of Annie....in anticipation of yet another version we ordered in \"the original\" and had a most enjoyable evening of classic musical comedy.\nThe extras , we watched every frame and to back this up checked out Wikipedia's summation.\nThe sound on our new Yamaha 7 \/ 1 system was crystal clear and the picture quality superb!","8866":"Excited to watch...haven't seen this movie in years!!  Ready to show my kids the movies we watched back in the day!  LOL","8868":"Annie is a classic movie that shows little girls how to stand up for themselves and be strong as well as stand up for friends. The movie also has great music. My daughter and I love this movie!","8869":"i STILL LAUGH WHEN I WATCHED THIS MOVIE WITH MY CHILDREN 35YEARS LATER. I LOVE THIS WHOLESOME MOVIE. COULD HAVE DONE WITH THE HINT OF MAJIC, WHICH DIDN'T ALLOW ME TO PURCHASE. IF IT WASN'T FOR THAT, I WOULD HAVE PURCHASED IT THE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE WATCHED IT DAILY AND THEY ARE 10 AND 13. CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEW VERSION IN THE WINTER","8870":"My handicapped daughter has this as a frequent watch, so it was nice to see it in widescreen and blu-ray quality.  Even I enjoyed watching again because of that.","8871":"my friend saw this movie when he was around 5 years old I am so glad its now available dvd","8872":"My girls loved the story and never trier of watching it. they were 4 & 5 when I purchased it. Now they are 6 & 7 and still love it.","8873":"A real classic.  I was replacing my VCR tape, which I gave to my grandson.  I still like VHS better than DVD, except for it takes less space","8877":"MY  MOM  LOVED  WATCHING  ANNIE  GROWING  UP\nSO  SHE  WANTED  IT  GOT  IT  TODAY  LOVED  WATCHING  IT\nSHE  WAS  LAUGHING  AND  ENJOYED  ANNIE  SO  MUCH\n  THANKS","8878":"Comical,good music, well acted. If you like musicals, this shold float your boat!  Albert Finney is name recognition butthe actress who played Annie ...made the movie.","8879":"I love this movie. Singing and  Carol Burnett  as Miss Hannigan there is no one better. Bernadette Peters, Tim Curry, Albert Finney and Sandy. I love every sec of this movie.","8880":"Love this version of Annie! I had the soundtrack growing up and listened to it all the time! Definitely a classic!","8881":"Awesome!","8882":"my hero love it","8883":"I got this movie for my sister. She really loved it. She was very happy with it. Very much satisfied.","8885":"This is exactly what I wanted. It actually shipped faster than I expected and got it a day earlier. VEry happy with my purchase, great product at a good price. Fun extra's plus its a Sing-A-Long which my 4 year old LOVES!","8886":"I bought this three years ago and we've watched it a dozen times since.  The grandkids love the music and we watch it often.","8887":"If I knew more about how the courts are, or were, set up in Rumpole's time, I might have enjoyed this series more.\nBe your own judge there.","8888":"Pretty dated, but enjoyable when you get beyond that.  Very slow by todays standards.","8889":"thanks","8890":"Fantastic","8891":"Anyone planning to buy this set should take a look at my review of \"Rumpole of the Bailey: The Complete Series [Region 2],\" which I bought in June, 2016.  Many people don't care about subtitles, but if you need them, as I do, consider buying the \"Region 2\" set for about $7.00 more, as I did, because my experience was that I got a \"Region 0\" set of disks that play just fine on an American \"Region 1\" player.","8892":"Well worth the price. This was excellent. The movie is great. Movie arrived promptly and was in brand new condition. Very sweet story. This was adorable.","8893":"this is a great movie to watch and have fun with the actors and watch when ever you want to watch","8894":"great classic.my son loves it and it made an awesome gift! would like to get more classic movies...cant beat some of the classics!!!","8895":"Well, I must admit the dvd is in good condition, and the extra feature with Aileen Quinn was great.  Wish the movie was better (no fault of Carol Burnett's).","8896":"I saw a special on PBS about the making of this movie.  The story focused on the choreography mostly.\nI have always enjoyed the story and the actors.  This version is especially finger snapping, foot patting\ngood.","8897":"Most enjoyable series.  However, even though I spent my childhood in London in the 1950s I regret the absence of subtitles.  Part of the problem is that I am hard of hearing.","8898":"wonderfully funny and well done. (\"She who must be obeyed.\")","8899":"I watched it on tv when I was younger and it is so nice to share with my son now. A joy to watch.","8900":"A classic in both comedy and mystery","8901":"Better than I remember it !","8902":"How can you not enjoy anything with Leo McKern in it?!","8903":"As movie is the first time I've ever seen the story.  In the Sunday comic section, which I pored over, it was always there, but never caught my interest.  The movie was my first experience with Annie.  It was a good experience.\nFunny, when I was a kid, I had no interest in Annie, but now, at 72 years old, I found the movie entertaining.","8904":"I saw this as a child and loved it. Now as an adult I still feel the same way. Such a great movie I had to add it to my DVD collection.","8905":"One of my all time favorite musicals.  All the characters were wonderful but I don't remember Daddy Warbucks as married which is implied at the end of the movie.","8906":"I had the priate version of this movie. It was 16x9.\nI decided to buy this in DVD. It was 4:3.\nI was so dissapointed.\nI didn't checked clearly about the format.\nNow I am very sad.\nIt's 1980's movie for christ sake.","8907":"Great series. Nice to have an introduction by the author for each episode. Audio seems a bit muddy between characters although narration is clear.","8908":"This has got to be one of my favorite series of all time!","8909":"Great classic British tv","8910":"What a collection of thoroughly entertaining stories. Excellent acting by all actors, all familiar faces of British productions.","8911":"A reliable entertainment. A personal friend from the past, that has as much enjoyment now as when I first watched them.","8912":"I love Rumpole of the Bailey. Its a classic. Well written, great story lines and you will try to figure out how Rumpole will get his client off.\nIt is humorous, witty drama, leaving you wanting more. Most enjoyable, will watch over and over again. You get to know the personal aspects of each of the characters besides at the Bailey. It is entertaining and well worth buying. I highly recommend it.  Bob susanville, Calif.","8913":"The movie of course is great.  The Blu-ray is stunning.  The picture and audio are fantastic.  This is a great version.","8914":"This was great, and the little lead actress is so-o-o talented.  The actor playing Daddy Warbucks is fantastic, and I'm appalled he didn't have a more advanced career after this.  Took real skill to be convincing in his role of a male character who went from cold, calculating and cruel to a kind, compassionate father who understood all little kids.","8915":"Have watched 1 DVD so far, a little hard to make out speech sometimes.","8916":"Faultless . The introductions by John Mortimer were wonderful and all the various characters were superb...surely one of the best series ever made","8917":"Rumpole, a barrister who represents criminals at the Old Bailey law courts in London is excellently portrayed by Leo McKern. The other characters in the series are also well represented by their actors, with some cameo performances by well known British actors. The tenor of the series is laid back and all of the episodes have a theme. This set is very enjoyable and represents very good value for money.","8918":"I always loved the film Annie.\nAnd I am so happy to have it on Blu-Ray.\nA real joy to watch.","8919":"My granddaughter loves loves loves Annie, she's two and walks around the house singing tommorow! Then says \"you sing\" she gets us all singing :) so we know after buying the DVD and cd of Annie for Christmas they'll both be worn out by February OR sooner lol","8920":"I use this in teaching ESL to adults.  It arrived in perfect condition and my students love it.  They get vocabulary and accents not possible from the textbooks from both the spoken dialogue and the songs--the melodies of which will keep that vocabulary and grammar in their heads for life.","8921":"I've always loved this movie and not realizing I didn't have it on dvd, prompted me to finally buy it.","8922":"This is a great movie.  If you have seen the play of Annie you will like this just as well.  I have seen both and just love this movie.  Its cute and funny with how the girls get into trouble and get out of it also and Carol Barnette is great in this.  Carol was so funny in her weekly TV show back in the 70's and part of the 80's and in this movie she still didn't lose her funny quirky self in this movie either.","8923":"great for kids my opinion, carol burnett in it and many others, great for teaching kids, has games on it, a must have a huge 10 thanks","8924":"Little Orphan Annie was my all time favorite funny strip. And now I can watch the musical anytime I want on my Kindle Fire.","8925":"my daughter has watch this like 10 times. she loves this movie, so i had to buy it for her. she is only 7 years old. i would recommend this item. this movie is a classic.","8927":"I was disappointed that subtitles were not included. The British accents, the speed of the actors' speaking, and the off-to-the-side lines that were spoken softly, made this hard to follow. In the first episode I thought Rumpole had lost the case, and it turned out that he had won. I'll keep watching and hoping I get used to the delivery of the lines, but I really wish they'd thought to add subtitles for us Yankees.","8929":"I cannot understand how ANY DVDs these days lack subtitles.  I am hard of hearing.  If it had subtitles I would buy it, but NOT now!","8930":"Great collection, and excellent writing and acting.  Well worth keeping  forever.","8931":"love this series.  Rumpole is super duper","8932":"I love it !!!!  Pomposity to the extreme.","8933":"Needed closed captioning","8934":"Great acting and extremely funny.","8935":"Rumpole is that crafty barrister of the Old Baily.  It is so satisfying to know that we have hours and hours of watching Rumpole and the other lawyers in Chambers.  Rumpole's cases are always interesting and full of characters.  If you haven't discovered Rumpole, and \"she who must be obeyed\", you are missing a treat.","8936":"Very nice item, even better than pictured.","8937":"If you like Rumpole this is for you. It gives methe opportunity of watching more than one in an evening.","8938":"this was a childhood favorite and i got to share this with my children...they absolutely loved it and keep fast forwarding to the singing every time they watch it.","8940":"These are classic of British humor, and at a great price.  I gave up cable due to limited stuff I want to watch and exorbitant costs.  Netflix at under $10 per month for unlimited viewing, supplemented with dvds such as Rumpole work out very well.  Thanks for the low price, fast shipping.","8941":"Wow, the complete Rumpole!  I have always enjoyed this series; such fine acting.  Now that I have the whole series, I can enjoy it any time.","8943":"A truly great series and one to be watched and enjoyed over and over again.  Leo McKern was a genius, in my opinion he was to Rumpole what David Suchet is to Poirot and Jeremy Brett to Holmes.  Outstanding and John Mortimor author of Rumpole a brilliant and prolific mind.","8944":"Bought this for my kids as once again I go to this original version being much better then the \"New and Improved\" version!","8945":"First the good stuff.  It's really in widescreen like its theatrical release!  The picture looks good for a catalogue title.  Special features are lacking but it's an inexpensive disc. The digital copy is for ultraviolet and it's Standard definition which is too bad.","8946":"I really love this Movie of Annie (The Classic Edition DVD)\nis playable in the Widescreen & Full Screen Format on 1 disc\nThe disc is single sided. I think the TV version of Annie\nstarring Kathy Bates as Miss Hannigan was poor.\n\nThe Full Screen and Widescreen are\nlisted in the \"product Details\"\n\nNot by this \"Annie (Widescreen Edition)\"\nWhen you go to the classic edition DVD.","8947":"i had to buy this dvd since my college goes to the \"mansion\" where it was filmed, monmouth university.  it was cheaper here than the college bookstore - and i just love the movie.","8948":"Hours of enjoyable viewing","8949":"It was great.","8950":"Rumpole is a true singular character. He is the  center of the British legal comedy and all else revolves around him.  He loves everything about the court and it's players.  This series is what you watch when your brain needs rebooting.","8951":"Must have TV. Rumpole was so popular, and this wonderful set rekindles the fire that he set under us so many years ago. Leo McKern was perfect in the role of Rumpole, so much so that he made the character his own - much like David Suchet has done with Agatha Christie's Poirot. One of my favourite DVD sets. Thoroughly recommended.","8952":"Great series, love this kind of comedy\/drama","8953":"My kids really enjoy the suspense at the end of this version of Annie. Carol Burnett's Mrs. Hannigan is a little tougher\/rougher than in the Disney version, but my middle schoolers prefer this one. For younger viewers, I would recommend the Disney version where Kathy Bates plays Mrs. H.","8954":"My granddaughter loves this movie. I wanted to get a copy of it so when she comes over we can watch it together. Thanks for your fast shipping and low price","8955":"I really have enjoyed the movie and am glad to have obtained it for my collection. You must own it also","8956":"If you are a Leo McKern fan and like his Rumpole of the Bailey series, you should have this set. Each episode comes complete with John Mortimer explaining what he had in mind when he wrote each story. Fascinating, entertaining, and if you find that \"she who must be obeyed\" rings a chord in your life, you have no choice but to invest in this Rumpole megaset.","8957":"Saw this series on Masterpiece Theater","8958":"I was glad to find this series since I had seen it when it first came out. Love Rumpole's wry sense of humor and always love how this series plays out. Fun viewing!","8959":"If you like your English barristers brilliant but eccentric, you can't do better than Rumpole.  Leo McKern brings John Mortimer's beloved, but underrated criminal defender to life with humor, irony, gusto, and just a slight undercurrent of sadness in his great, droopy eyes as the establishment, which can't best him in a courtroom, frequently fails to honor him outside of one.","8960":"I've bought quite a few movies for my friend, like me her VCR died so now she has to replace all her VHS tapes with DVDs. She's kind of like my mother, had to learn new techs to be able to enjoy her movies.\nShe keeps telling me how much she enjoys watching these movies.","8961":"Have seen the newer version as well as a play. This by far is THE best! We all loved it!","8962":"2 words:  Carol Burnett.  Are you kidding?  Funny, raunchy, rotten, awful, yet somehow lovable character performed by well known tv variety show personality.  A great movie, but the heartwarming aspect mitigated by some excellent reality.","8963":"Not remastered - but a bargain at this price, considering you get the entire series.  Great, great show - and I had forgotten how funny it was at times.  Highly recommended by she-who-must-be-obeyed.","8964":"Gave as a gift--he loves it.","8965":"This one \"grew\" on me. Some words hard to understand but will probably enjoy watching again.","8966":"She who must be obeyed rules!  Loved it.","8967":"I love watching Rumpole of the Bailey , the interactions of the British legal system, the old fashion legal system.","8968":"I agree with all the positive reviews! Well written, acting is top notch, superb.  I'm very happy with this purchase.","8969":"Digital beautiful copy of a great broadway musical. Heartwarming story. The extra material by the star, now grown up, shows how it affected her life.","8970":"This movie is always special to children and adults alike. It's is definitely a classic. I got a great price on it and the delivery was fast as it always seems to be with Amazon.","8971":"This is another movie to be watched over and over.  It is a fun, uplifting story with a great cast.","8972":"If you enjoy British humor and great acting you will want to view this series -- Rumpole of the Bailey is a great story of a defense attorney's case load and how he uses his wit and knowledge of the law to solve his cases.","8974":"The dry humor of the Brits comes thru.  Also like to see the way they deal with cases in court.  I'd much rather be an attorney in the US !!\n\nOur chihuahua monitors our daily activities, and we now call HER 'She Who Must Be Obeyed' !\n\nJohn Mortimer (author) and Leo McKern (Rumpole) are absolute geniuses.","8975":"This was my daughters favorite when she was a little girl. We still love to watch it to this day.  It's a movie the whole family can watch together,","8976":"I gave it to her.  She rehurses to it.  She visited us for spring break and sang the entire show.  It was fabulous!","8977":"Used to watch this every Thursday evening years ago.  This has been a trip down memory lane.  If you can get used to the poor quality of the DVD just due to video technology of the time, the content is still superb.","8979":"Sometimes our older generation in other professions show us what honesty and integrity means.  Rumpole using logic and truth defends his clients with all the wit and cunning of a master chess player.  This is a great series dished out with subtle humour and wit keeps one at the edge of your seat to its conclusion.  I recommend Rumpole of the Bailey to anyone the slightest interested in British comedy!","8980":"Can't beat Rumpole of the Bailey; however, the range of accents and Rumpole's mumbled asides makes the dialog sometimes hard to hear\/understand without closed captioning or subtitles.  Otherwise, as excellent as it was years ago on television.","8982":"We watched these when they ran on PBS many years ago, then rented them for our own rerun.  Finally we have decided when wanting to watch the series again, to buy it so we can watch the old guy anytime we are in the mood.  We have watched it again, rationing ourselves to no more than 2  episodes a night!","8983":"My wife and I were pleased that we were able to find the complete series of Rumpole of the Bailey.  The set is reasonably priced and of good quality.","8984":"If I were arrested then I would want Rumpole defending me...unless of course we were sitting before Judge Bullingham! Just glad not to be a Timson!","8986":"Watching this on a 60\" Sharp LED TV the picture is better than I thought it would be.  I can see the individual strands of Annie's fuzzy hair!","8987":"Where they go to Radio City Music Hall, they watch Camille. First it is show in wide screen, which did not exist, so they cut off the top and bottom of the image. Second, their source material was extremely grainy and the film needs to have a restored version inserted. Watching the blurry, grainy images just takes you out of the film.","8988":"Wish the current Law & Order type series could adopt some of Rumpole's style. Really glad I could find the complete set.","8989":"I love the British! I love anything that has to do with the English way of life and I love  Character actors and Rumpole of the Bailey with his dry  sense of humor, with his cheap liquor and cigars and his wife \"who must be obeyed\", is just my cup of tea. I love them all and plan on watching them again and again. If you love disheveled court fighters, and a character that is always pissing someone off, Rumpole is you man. You will love him!","8990":"The movie arrived promptly but when played, parts of the dialogue could not be heard at all which made the movie less enjoyable for everyone watching...but especially the children.","8991":"My kids weren't thrilled at first to watch this but since then, they've asked to watch it again and again.  Classic!","8992":"This new 30th Anniversary Sing-Along edition of ANNIE in BLU RAY is in the film's original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.40:1. Amazon should delete all the above D V D reviews as they steer potential buyers away from purchasing the BEST home video presentation of ANNIE in many years. Those customers interested in a Pan & Scan presentation should buy the DVD. This blu ray is in WIDESCREEN!","8993":"A look at a past more civilised world. We do not have many people like Rumpole who, are there for people not reward.","8994":"I bought this set over a year ago and am on the third go-through of the set.  That guy cracks me up.  Doesn't conform to the accepted role of lawyer.","8995":"I have a hearing loss so, like in many British TV productions, I have some difficulty with dealing with the British accents.  However, Rumpole is such a great character, I love watching the programs.","8996":"In box with plastic wrap and no peanuts that was a plus and everything was great and packgaged well yay.","8997":"Rumpole is an unlikely hero, both sarcastic and grumpy, and as politically incorrect as possible.  He manages, just barely, to keep up and to save his clients.","8998":"It's an Oldie but a GOODIE. Leo McKern as Rumpole of the Bailey. Buy the complete series and ENJOY. A tremendous look back at what once was in the London legal and court system. Entertaining and instructive, both.","8999":"My daughter wanted this classic for Christmas and we watch it over and over and the story never gets old.","9000":"I wasn't sure if it would be well adapted to film but it was. This is a timeless musical for everyone.","9001":"I bought this for my nieces and they are thrilled.  They will watch it repeatedly, never tiring of watching the same movie repeatedly.  I bought it durinh bad weather, knowing that they would get cabin fever if they were trapped inside for too long.  Problem solved.","9002":"Family musical anyone can enjoy. Carol Burnett is a blast to watch as Miss Hannigan. In a supporting role I particularly liked seeing Colleen Zenk who played Barbara Ryan on As The World Turns for many years.","9003":"Great \"Feel Good\" video. It came very quickly. Thanks you for your service. Good to watch with your whole family.","9004":"I originally watched this on PBS and when I saw the deal on Amazon, I thought I would buy it.  I am not sorry I did.  I have started watching it from the very beginning and it is great.  It may take me a few months to watch the whole series, it is something to look forward to on the weekend when you want to curl up with a good book or in this case movie.","9005":"It is fun to review these shows that I watched on TV in the past.  Still fun and enjoyable.  Very well written and acted.","9007":"Rumpole of the Bailey is a great show.  I believe it changed the way television \"looked at\" the legal profession in some ways.  It is interesting to watch as it was a show of the 70's and thus styles, etc. are interesting.  I can't imagine anyone else but Leo McKern being cast in the role of Rumpole.  Outstanding \"old\" television viewing.","9008":"Arrived on time.  Each DVD contains 2 (or,occasionally, 3) episodes; I think 6 years in all.  Lots of fun and we're watching them on odd evenings, interspersing with lots of other stuff.  Should take us the best part of a year, at least.","9009":"I'm a big fan of Rumpole and have been watching the show for years on PBS. Now I have the whole series and can choose any episode to watch whenever I like! I have to say the transfer to DVD was not the greatest but still far better than many old TV series that I've seen. There are pricier DVDs of Rumpole out there with slightly better looking transfers but this one is good and the price was right.","9010":"Great series aired from 1978 to 1992. One of my concerns was about video and sound quality, which I am glad to report are fine. Probably excellent considering that the broadcasts were pre-HD. We haven't watched all of the series yet. There ARE 42 episodes plus extra features and a movie.\n\nExcellent entertainment and a real bargain!","9012":"WITH LEO MCKERN LEADING THE WAY JOHN MORTIMER BRINGS HIS STORIES ABOUT A LAWYER FOR THE MASSES AND NOT THE SWELLS TO THE SMALL SCREEN.  BEDEVILED BY HIS \"SHE WHO MUST BE OBEYED\" WIFE AND DISAPPOINTED THAT HIS BELOVED SON WON'T FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS HE SOLDIERS ON HIS WRY, CLEVER AND WORLD-WEARY COURSE.  YOU'LL WATCH THESE OVER AND OVER AND FIND SOMETHING NEW EVERY TIME.","9013":"I bought the complete Rumpole series years ago at a cost so much higher than this price.\n\nIt is of an older style.  The characters are so human.  All of the episodes are based on  Mortimers books, I think, and I have the books.  Set in the current time of the mid 1970s to the early 1990s the episodes concern common regular folks in London for the most part.\n\nHuman vanitys abound so often in ironic humorous situations.  Sometimes it goes a bit too far but still believable.","9014":"i love this very much and i will share this with everbody i know it was funny to me and great.","9015":"Gift for granddaughter. She's enjoying it with us and her mom who also loved Annie when she was a little girl.","9019":"What can ya say? Great actor, great scripts, ahead of it time series. I'll always enjoy the adventures of the man who married \"she who must be obeyed\".","9020":"My daughter has been singing the songs for this movie ever since we watched it.  She has also watched it approximately once per week since we got it.","9021":"This is such a marvelous rendition of Annie. I listen to it daily and it makes me smile and feel great.","9022":"I'd forgotten how terrific a movie this is.  Great music and wonderful characters.  A cast at their peak.  Don't miss this musical.","9024":"I've actually never seen this one, but my fiancee really enjoys it.  The cover looks pretty great though, and who doesn't love red-headed moppets?","9025":"So far so good, the mega set seems quite complete, very satisfied. Leo McKern is Horace Rumpole, wit,style, and a british bulldog when it comes to defending his clients. The stories never get old no matter how many times I watch them. I would highly recomend these dvd collection to anyone.","9027":"The series is very interesting and Rumpole is a character and most enjoyable.  The only problem I had with the set was that it is so very English and hard to understand at times.  Liked it very much.  A great buy for the money.","9028":"I'm not generally a lover of British TV but Rumpole is hilarious.  He is surrounded be a bunch of idiots (except for the lovely Portia)and they are all gunning for him.  This, Sherlock Holmes, and Faulty Towers are British at it's best.","9029":"Excellent product I recommend it 100% top quality it always guaranteed gacalidad can buy with confidence for this place satisfied with the good product recommended","9035":"I got these DVDs for my husband's birthday and we both love them!\nWe watched them when they were on PBS, but did not see them all.\nThere are 4 episodes on each disk and 14 disks.  Will keep us going for a while!\nWe are relishing each episode and they have all been as good as we remember the ones on TV being.\n\nIt is fun watching blustery Rumpole solve crimes while handling \"she who must be obeyed\"!!!","9036":"Such an excellent movie.  I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.","9038":"you have to have Annie! Fun movie and is age appropriate all across the board. must share with your kids!","9039":"A movie you can watch with your family no matter what age your children are. Fun and laughing is great!","9040":"Believe it or not this movie is HD all the way, its a great story and a clear crisp picture and sound.","9041":"Can anyone who would buy this in the first place not like it?  I think not.  This is a great series.  Leon McKern is absolutely perfect as Horace Rumpole.  If you have doubts about this series, forget them.  It's worth every penny for hours and hours of head scratching amusement.  It can be a bit \"stodgy\" I suppose for the younger viewers but for an old crone like myself - absolutely wonderful.","9042":"Fantastic an excellent series\nvery well writen and acted\nI recommend it to any one who ejoys quality programs despite the aged attitudes to life in some aspects those you can view with an historical eye.\n<a data-hook=\"product-link-linked\" class=\"a-link-normal\" href=\"\/Rumpole-of-the-Bailey-The-Complete-Series-Megaset\/dp\/B000CRR360\/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8\">Rumpole of the Bailey: The Complete Series Megaset<\/a>","9043":"This is a very nice box set of the complete Rumpole of the Bailey series.  Each episode is prefaced with a short introduction by John Mortimer, which is a nice addition. The series' only deficit is the lack of subtitles option.","9044":"A BRITISH LAWYER WITH A WIFE WHO RULES. HE'S FAT AND FUNNY  AND THE ENGLISH JUDGE GIVES HIM A HARD TIME.HE SEAMS TO OVER COME AND WINS THE DAY. GREAT FUN","9045":"My daughter (16) loved this movie when she was a little girl and watched over and over and over. Lately she has developed an appreciation for old movies and I thought it would be nice to get her this one. She was so happy!!! I think it's a great movie for all ages, a real classic! And I would definitely recommend it for any little girl (6 and above).","9046":"It was packaged really well and shipped promptly. I had it before it said that I would have it. Of course I love this movie. Oldie but goodie.","9047":"Always a treat! This ginger is a die-hard orphan with talent & the will to survive.  I loved this movie as a child & my children love it too!","9050":"Leo McKern was wonderful as Rumpole.  The stories were excellent, multilayered, humor, pathos and wonderful characters.  You will see a lot of actors that have appeared in other series and its fun to see them in this series.\n\nLoved the books and the series.","9053":"THIS is the version you want to watch (1982) - it's the \"only\" one in my opinion.  Aileen Quinn, Albert Finney, Carol Burnett, Tim Curry, Bernadette Peters and Ann Reinking - a phenominal cast.  Every kid should get to watch this at least once in their life!  Catchy songs -  and Ms. Hannigan!!","9056":"Most things I Review I say yep or nope. So Im short about 19 0r so words for your review.","9061":"My husband and father both enjoy these very much.  They are very faithful to the books written by John Mortimer and Leo McKern does an excellent job of bringing Rumpole to life.","9062":"What can you say about Rumpole that isn't good.  The commentary by Leo Mckern really makes the product outstanding.  Mckern's appearance is comedic itself.","9063":"I must've seen this movie 20 times growing up and I have never seen this movie is such amazing quality. If you are a fan of Annie, I highly recommend picking up the Blu-Ray version. You won't be disappointed.","9064":"A fine Blue Ray presentation.  It may not be loaded with great songs, but the dance numbers are terrific.  It is worth viewing to see Carol Burnette mug her way through a hilarious role.","9067":"as advertised","9072":"After Midsomer Murders, Foyle's War, I was in search for more great Brit \"Who Done It\" type mysteries.  This doesn't exactly match but it was so much fun watching Rumpole.  It's a legal world of crime and civil problems using slight handed humor, sarcasm, moral dilema, you name it, all the humun elements are there.  A complete surprise and great entertainment.  Once you conquer the language barrier just sit back and enjoy.","9075":"Movie was new, as described and arrived quickly.  My granddaughter and I enjoyed watching it many times already!  Great way to introduce the older, classic films, especially musicals to kids who are drenched with the Disney Channel.","9077":"I bought these after hearing several good radio theater Rumpole shows. The video Rumpole character is little more than a hopless British WC Fields less the sense of humor. I'm not sure these are worth donating to the thrift store.","9078":"The wit and humor of the scourge of the Old Baily lives just as I remember him from my days in England too many years ago. My ear for English accents has lost some of its sensitivity over the years, but there is no doubt that Horace R. remains a classic and memorable leader of subtle British humor. I lift my glass of Chateau Fleet Street in his honor!","9079":"Leo McKern's understated Rumpole is a joy on every level, especially if you're curious to see the subtleties of British justice. While some episodes are more watchable than others, the performances are universally excellent.","9080":"As a big fan of British comedy and drama, I have to say Rumpole is one of the very best.  Production values are only fair, but Leo McKern \"is\" Rumpole.  The superb supporting cast only serves to add to the fun.","9082":"Nothing will ever compare to the original! Even after all this time I can still sit and watch Annie over and over again. The talent of all the kids who took part in this production is simply amazing! Long live ANNIE!","9084":"She loves this movie!!","9085":"great","9086":"Good for fans of Elmo and \"Sesame Street\". I purchased it for the adult cast, especially Ruth Buzzi as Ruthie . A harmless time-filler for people of all ages:-)","9088":"Anyone who enjoys fine stories with quirky characters and great dialogue, will enjoy Rumpole of the Bailey.  Pop it in, sit back and enjoy....","9089":"I liked this series when it was on TV awile back.  Rumpole is quite a character and realizes early on that because he likes criminal law and particularly being a defense lawyer that he will never be Head of Chambers.  He accepts that, but his wife definitely does not.  She is a social climber from the word \"go\".  If I ever needed a defense attorney, I would like to have someone like him defending me.","9090":"We couldn't  be more pleased than we are with the Rumpole of the Bailey series.  Excellent condition, excellent product.  Thank  you!","9091":"I bought it for my 4 yr old and he absolutely loves it. Elmo is his fav character","9092":"My two daughters loved this movie when they were little and now my grandaughter saw it in music class in school and she also loves it.  GREAT FAMILY MOVIE!!!","9093":"Annie's Special Anniversary Edition is offered in Region 2 Widescreen format via amazon.com.uk.  Amazon.com's Region 1 version was released on 13th Jan 2004 and available only in full screen format.  Three months later on 19 April 2004, a widescreen format was released in Region 2.  Why the double standards?","9094":"If you want hours of mind testing then TRY to out do THIS Old Bailey Hack and find the truth to the case!","9098":"Such a cute movie. Both my kids loved it and we as parents enjoyed it too","9099":"Cute video. My daughter loves elmo so we needed some for the long car ride to the beach. These worked great!","9101":"Granddaughter loved most of the movie (the only part she didn't like was when one character said he was going to \"kill\" some of the little kids - she said it scared her). But the music is fantastic and it is a classic.","9102":"My special needs son LOVES Elmo!!","9103":"Great Elmo movie and great lesson to the movie.","9104":"Elmo Rocks\nGreat Movie","9106":"Lots of cussing, using God's name in vain. Drinking. Smoking. Mean guy tries to kill Annie. Woman wears very immodest night gown in one scene.","9108":"I thought I already did this once, but....  Got the movie about a week after I ordered it - phenomenal!!  It was in very good condition - great service!!!","9110":"I GOT THIS AFTER SEEING IT ON TV. BUT BE SURE TO GET THIS ONE, THE REMAKE ISN'T AS GOOD.\nTHIS IS INDEED A CLASSIC WORTH ADDING TO YOUR COLLECTION","9111":"None.","9112":"Were all (actual) widescreen prints destroyed or something? I'm not a big fan of this movie, in fact I much prefer the 1999 version that actually adapts the musical. But when I saw this for the first time it was in Pan and Scan and yet during A Hard Knock Life you could see the kids knocking themselves out clearly. Here they zoomed in on the picture so that they knock themselves out offscreen. And this has the worst pan and scan job ever too- half the time we only see the characters' noses.","9114":"Updated on February 07 2009 at 4:10 PM PST\n\nIf it's Recordable i'll let everyone know and i'll do some Freebees for 3 or 4 of you. I have 2 people chosen already.\nIf you are (Apes Fan) and (Mr. P.F.Curran) please leave a comment and i'll get back to you.\n\nVic\n\nThe 1 Star is for the Foolscreen version only.","9115":"This is by far the best Elmo movie. My child adores it. We watched it so much when it was prime and then we purchased it when it was no longer under prime. A must watch for any young Elmo fans!","9116":"An epic disaster. Bad acting. Poorly sung. The cast are all acting in different movies. Get the Disney tv version which is superior to this film in every way.","9118":"I love this movie. My favorite song in the movie is It's a Hard Knock Life for us!\nThis movie was everything I loved about musical genre the plot enhanced by singing and dancing. The best scene is when Annie goes to Daddy Warbucks Mansion. I truly would have loved to be in that bed the maids were fixing up it looked comfy and warm like a cloud on a summer's day.\nI especially adored everyone who lived in the mansion they made life more cheery than the huge hallways and luxury baths, Artwork and fine china.","9119":"The movie is older but that doesn't stop my toddler from wanting to watch it over and over. It is cute and tolerable for my husband and I to watch. Perfect for any littles ones that love Elmo.","9120":"Great movie!","9121":"A must for every house to own. A classic for our family.","9122":"She is an orphine in the 20s, that is a double whammy. The richest man in town adoptes her.","9123":"My 2-year old grandson loves this movie!","9124":"Love it","9128":"I may be 74 years old, but I love Elma and the gang","9130":"I love this musical!  So happy to have it on DVD!  Rich in color and clarity.","9131":"Best movie","9132":"I was very happy with the product and the transaction, would do business again!\n\nThank you","9134":"Super cute children's movie! Sometimes the movies based off tv shows fall short, this one was great! My toddler loves it so much. Great songs and all the Seasame Street characters he loves. He loves it so much that when it went from Free to rent, we bought it! No problems with the video quality either. Perfect!","9136":"what a waste of money-WIDESCREEN- its how the movie was made you morons-spend your money on the out of print edition this one is stupid C.R.A.P!","9138":"If you haven't already seen this one, do not wait until \"Tomorrow\", do it today.\n\nThis is one of the most delightful musicals of recent years. Great performances by Aileen Quinn as Annie, Albert Finney as Daddy Warbucks, Carol Burnett is outstanding as Ms Hannigan and Tim Curry & Bernadette Peters make convincing nasties. The music is great and the easy-to-miss one-liners are delightful. All-in-all, a must see, and a must-possess movie.","9139":"THIS IS A MUSICAL THAT CAN BE SEEN AGAIN AND AGAIN AND YOU WILL NEVER GROW WEARY OF IT!\n\nYOU MAY EVEN CATCH YOURSELF SINGING SOME OF THE WORDS!\n\nTHIS IS THE ULTIMATE VERSION OF ANNIE AND IS A FAMILY CLASSIC TO BE TREASURED FOR MANY YEARS TO COME!!\n\nBESIDES, WITH CAROL BURNETT, HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG?","9141":"Now my 4 yo granddaughter has to see it every time she visits. It's a great moie for kids and not bad for adults who hae to watch with them.","9142":"I still own the original DVD release for this film which sports the great panavision 2.20:1 aspect ratio... how can you offer a new and better special edition of a film like this and use a Pan\/Scan version beefed up by new audio tracks? Who ever was responsible for this should have been fired immediatly nbo questions asked they obviously have no love for the original aspect ratio of any film let alone Annie. What a waste of a release and time and effort.","9145":"A John Huston disaster! Some nice touches, a great Annie and a nifty Punjab..but too much overacting in this overproduced musical.  But thank heaven the songs weren't ruined by this rococo mess.\n\nCall me spoiled, but l saw and greatly prefer the Broadway version which respected a more sophisticated audience and which gave us several \"inside\" and tongue-in-cheek jokes. The movie rams everything down the viewer's throat. And the ending was worthy of Ziegfeld...who's been dead for awhile.","9146":"A great old Musical with great stars.  A must see for music lovers!","9154":"This DVD is one of the essentials, if you like musicals.  The songs are familiar, the dance numbers good, and Carol Burnett was great.  My biggest beef with the DVD is that it is only available in full-screen format.  You can tell that the viewing area is cut back with this format, the studio should do the right thing and release a widescreen version.","9156":"Really small on the back cover you'll find your purchased an all new anniversary FULL SCREEN version of this movie. Only released this way apparently.  Wasn't until I popped it in that I found this out.  If I could return it I would and go buy the original release which apparently has both full and wide.","9158":"Children loved it and so did I","9161":"Was very happy to see this","9162":"If you are any type of movie collector, don't waste your time with this pointless FULL SCREEN version. This is a wonderful, wonderful film that deserves to be treated as such. Why a studio would waste time and effort by releasing crap is beyond me. I am usually a vigilant shopper when it comes to DVD, with a collection well over 400, but I made the mistake of purchasing this edition and now I am stuck returning it.","9164":"Carol Burnett really steals the show as a crazy drunk who runs an orphanage! This wacky lush tries to bed every man she comes in contact with & it is hilarious! The lil girl playing Annie is ugly, but it is cool that Lex Luthor adopts her and the mangy mutt.","9167":"Columbia Tristar you are a loser!!  You took a great film like Annie (1982) and shortage all of us with 1.33:1 .  This is an OUTRAGE.  Why this is even called a Spedical Edition.  Lucky I already own the widescreen version.","9168":"great movie my son loved it.","9170":"Annie the movie is one of my favorite movies and broadway plays. As a avid annie collector and obessed fan of the movie (seen at least 100 times)I'm glad to see the dvd of this great story about america's favorite orphan back out for this generation of kids to watch!!","9175":"My son is an Elmo lover so this movie caught his attention right away.","9176":"A great film, for its time, but never near what 'Annie' is meant to be.\nDon't get me wrong, I loved this little ginger fuzz ball for years but sadly the film is inferior to both the true Broadway intention and a more recent Buena Vista \/ Disney re-make. The latter is much more true to Broadway grandeur and razzmatazz which, in my opinion, could well leave this little orphan waiting for a `tomorrow' which will never come.","9181":"This was such a great movie. I was a child when this came out and at 21 I still enjoy watching it. It has an all-star cast: Carol Burnett (playing a comical, alcoholic Miss Hannigan), Bernadette Peters, and Tim Curry, just to name a few. The music is also very catchy and entertaining. This is a great film for children, families and even adults who want to feel like a kid again and it is also by far the best version of \"Annie\" to have ever been released!","9183":"Considering I have to watch it at least once a day it's really not that bad.","9184":"Very good.","9187":"Annie is the type of movie that I loved when I was 8 or 9 years old. I remember being mesmerized by the songs and the storyline! It was my absolute favorite movie during that time. Unfortunately, after watching Annie hundreds of times, I moved on to other movies.\nAnnie came on TV last year and my interest was renewed. I also loved the songs that I ignored when I was 8 years old, for example, \"We Got Annie\".","9189":"How could you not like this movie (Annie)!  It's so fun to watch.  It has all the classic music, and it's funny too!  Carol Brunett is often humorous and good as her role, and so is the girl that plays Annie.  It's a highly entertaining DVD that I recommend greatly!","9194":"DID NOT THINK KIDS LIKED IT","9199":"Didn't really pay too much attention to it, but my five-year-old daughter seemed to enjoy it.","9202":"The kids really enjoyed it.","9203":"11 year old and 2 year old really enjoyed the movie!","9204":"My granddaughter really enjoyed Elmo.","9205":"My granddaughter LOVES Elmo. Cute movie.","9206":"All time favorite for my kids and now my 18month old grandson too","9207":"Grandson enjoyed it","9208":"My grandson loves this movie yours will too.","9209":"Our great granddaughter loved this movie. She has never watched much of Sesame Street,  but was really taken with thus movie. Great music!","9210":"granddaughter 2 yrs old loves it  this has her  happy and glued","9211":"Can't lose with Elmo!!","9212":"Elmo in grouch land is a great stepping stone from Sesame Street. The kids loved watching and had fun after the 2nd and 3rd time watching singing along to all the fun songs. Elmo is always so cute and this gives kids more than the 15 mins from Elmo time on Sesame Street.","9213":"Fun for kids and adults alike - even Grandpas love this one!","9215":"Super cute with a good message. Mandy p makes a great villian!","9216":"Makes my daughter smile and laugh","9217":"Wonderful Bronson gem,often over looked.\nBroson,Coburn,Strother......great cast.\nBare knuckle,underground fights,set down south,during the depression.\nHighly recommended.","9218":"Sat and watched this through for the first time, having heard about this all my lifetime, I have to say that I enjoyed Bronson portrayal of a man's man of back in the day, didn't need anybody else, did his life on his terms. Pretty good movie.","9220":"It is another great Bronson movie when he was OK!","9221":"I've looked for this movie for some time. It's not a prolific movie but I like it.","9222":"What's not to love...It's Charles Bronson. Good action flic.","9223":"It's a very cute movie!!  My 2 year old can't even sit through an episode of Sesame Street, but totally was into this movie!! Love it!","9224":"Highly recommended","9225":"My son seems to like it!","9226":"Excellent quality and timely delivery.","9227":"Movie is hilarious.","9228":"The dvd is so funny.","9229":"Kids liked it","9230":"Monty Python ... ... what more need be said ... ...","9232":"I was surprised at the language and the frequent use of the F word.  I was hoping to show this classic to my 10 year old grandkids but will not be doing that.  Now that I'm 65 having never seen the complete film I found it to less funny that the few clips they normally show.  As with most film previews in 2 minutes they can show all the funny parts of the film.","9233":"My husband is a Monty Python fan and thoroughly enjoys this video.  It is a permanent part of our collection.","9234":"I'm still laughing after all these years","9236":"If you enjoy Monty Python's bizarre humor - this is some of his best.","9237":"Its a great movie. I recommend","9238":"nan","9239":"A GOOD CLASSIC BOXING MOVIE WITH BRONSON","9240":"awesome","9241":"One of our favorites.","9242":"Good Charles Bronson movie, also great supporting cast","9243":"I am a Bronson fan. This his best, I think.","9244":"Monty Python's best work","9245":"Cute movie.","9246":"Great movie, good plot, shows another aspect of the Depression in early half of the 20th century. Strongly recommend this to all movie fans.","9247":"Classic Charles Bronson movie.","9248":"Excellent product and service.  Great","9250":"The best Bronson movie ever","9251":"Great for the little ones who love Elmo!!!","9252":"This was the first Monty Python Movie I ever watched as a kid (and really considering some of the others the only one I was allowed to see as a kid) It continues to hold a special place in my heart. The movie is not technically family friendly but if you want to introduce your children to the classic comedy of Monty Python, this movie will do great.","9253":"The highest cinematic achievement in the history of mankind. Even Pepe approves.","9254":"When men were men and got on with life, this was the generation that 'rode the rail' winter and summer, then went into uniform to save the free world, and finally put a man on the moon.\n\nNow there are so many weak people, it will be interesting to see how many make it through the next great crisis....and yes...man's nature ensures that there always is a great crisis that gobbles up the weak...","9255":"Bronson at his best.","9257":"If you did not know, \"Charles Bronson\" was the man!","9258":"Classically hysterical movie. Especially if you like British Humour.","9259":"it is dry British humor","9260":"Very realistic fighting movie. Fight club in the 1960's.","9261":"Not interesting","9262":"I love this movie and it deserves 5 stars!","9263":"great","9264":"awesome, funny movie.!!!!","9265":"funny - good service","9266":"A classic must have! Brought back good laughters and memories!","9267":"Very good.","9268":"worked fine - as expected","9269":"Special Edition extra laughs! Super fast delivery, great service & products!","9270":"Movie reminds me of my deceased brother. He loved this movie.","9271":"yeah great","9272":"One of the best movies made.  Saw this at the theater with my father when I was very young.  The Rialto (historical, Denison, TX).  Now I get to see it in 4K UHD, and it looks amazing!","9273":"Bronson and Coburn were great.","9274":"a very cool movie","9275":"Great movie, a lot of memories","9276":"Kids loved this!","9277":"Our 2-year old absolutely loves this movie. So far, the only movie that keeps her attention for more than 10 minutes at a time. (Not sure if it's good that she watches that much tv anyway) This movie is an oldie and goodie.","9278":"My Grandson loves this movie,  I am so glad to add it to my movie collection.","9279":"Everybody loves Elmo!","9280":"great","9281":"My kids enjoyed it.","9282":"This movie is not shown on TV or hard to find on streaming.  The storyline was good and if you are a fan of Charles Bronson, it is a must see film.","9283":"very pleased","9284":"This movie is set during the days following the Great Depression, when ANYTHING was fair play. Charlie plays a brutal back-door brawler that works with James Coburn (the mouth) and battles for a percentage of cash wins over his opponents. A \"must see\" movie for Charles Bronson lovers!","9285":"Still as hilarious as ever, and the extras are great. I really appreciate the style of the DVD menus in that they share artwork and the same tone of the film.","9286":"4 yr old likes Elmo, but movie did not keep his attention","9287":"Good deal.","9288":"Bronson and Colbert work well together giving the flavor of the \"HardbTimes\" which live on today.","9289":"Nice movie that takes place in the Depression. Bronson is Bronson and is supported by a good cast. WEorth the effort to watch.","9290":"Excellent. Highly recommended.","9292":"Elmo Rules","9293":"This movie is comedy genius.","9294":"thanks","9295":"One of the movies ever!!","9296":"To quote Betelgeuse, \"it just gets funnier and funnier every time I see it!\"","9297":"We loved the dvd.","9298":"Love Monty Python. 1st movie I watched with my dad. Thanks for the great memories. Great movie...lots of laughs..","9299":"The music was really good.., and so was the plot","9300":"Very good film - gritty atmosphere and good action scenes. Bronson has always been at his best with a director that knew how to use his estimable talents as an actor. You don't give him much to say and you let his physical presence carry the scene.","9301":"it was better than expected","9302":"My grandson loved it, but as an adult, it did not keep my interest.  However, I watched it because it was important to him.","9303":"This is one of my favourite movies of all time.","9304":"Monty Python, enough said.","9305":"It takes a sophisticated mind to understand the sophisticated British humor","9306":"Great classic movie.","9307":"Great movie!!! Laughed all the way through it!!","9308":"It might be my daughters favorite movie ever...granted, she is two years old.","9309":"If you see one Monty Python movie this should be it ! Funny stuff.","9310":"Funniest movie ever","9311":"Maybe one of the best films ever.","9312":"My friend loves this movie","9313":"Great movie","9314":"I guess my husband liked it.","9315":"my grandson loved it, Elmo is his favorite","9316":"The castle and animals made the entire gift.","9317":"What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?\nI don't understand, African or European Swallow?\nI don't know that... AAAAAUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!","9318":"FUNNY , IMMEDIATELY GOT EVERY REFERENCE MADE,  , WELL WORTH IT","9319":"Great deal","9320":"FUNNEH","9321":"Uncle was happy with this!","9322":"Bronson is always good, so I thought I'd give Hard Times a try. Bronson needs to make some dough, so he agrees to do some fights, and he's good. Meanwhile, he meets a girl. So there's behind the scenes drama surrounding the fights and there's the budding relationship. All of this keeps it interesting, and the ending was a pleasant surprise. As for the characters, Bronson was as good as ever. None of the actors disappointed. --Roger Weston, author of The Recruiter","9323":"a well done and entertaining movie with a good cast","9324":"FUNNY AS HELL...","9327":"Great movie and story","9328":"One of Charlies best.","9329":"oh, the movie is really a great movie, it was just that there was no audio from Amazon on this movie, it was like watching a silent movie","9330":"Love this movie so funny and  I am very happy with my order.","9331":"Funny for all (appropriate) ages and funny in every era. It is truly a masterpiece of comedy.","9332":"Dumb.","9333":"My 2 year old kid loved it!","9334":"One of my favorite movies.","9335":"would purchase again","9336":"This is, at the very least, one of the best movies that I have ever seen.  It illustrates that correct life principles can and will lead to a successful\/fulfilling life, taking with it or blessing all the people, animals, and things in your life.","9337":"OMG. What a great movie","9338":"This movie holds its own even today!","9339":"its a classic","9340":"satisfied","9341":"a classic!","9342":"I love Bronson. Unfortunately most of the movies he's in aren't very good. HARD TIMES is the exception. A simple, elegant, entertaining film that doesn't feel dated. And one of the few movies in which the fight sequences feel legitimate.","9343":"Classic Charles Bronson. This movie hit the bulls eye.","9344":"great movie. Bronson great as usual","9345":"1","9346":"Arguably Bronson's best. Great story and characters. Beautifully recreated depression era New Orleans","9347":"All laughs and keeps the kids glued to the TV great for naptime and afternoon sleeptime","9348":"Classic Monty Python with lots of offbeat humor.","9349":"If you haven't seen this yet, you are in for a real treat!","9350":"A must have for those who enjoy a good comedy. Plus, it's in steelbook. What else could you ask for?","9351":"Perfect!","9352":"Excellent, old school movie. Simple plot with good action.","9353":"really good fight scenes","9354":"I have seen this movie quite a number of times and loved it each time. My grandchildren love it and so do I.","9355":"I LOVE this movie!  Anytime I need a laugh I will watch this.","9356":"These guys were great.","9357":"Very funny.","9358":"Entertaining and well-acted.  This movie is formulaic but very good and well worth the time to watch.","9359":"This is a wonderful picture. There's not a whole lot of dialogue, there is not a lot of wasted effort, just a straightforward story about a lonely fellow, A street fighter, who wanders into New Orleans during the depression, picks up a few fights, makes a little bit of money, and also let's not forget about the \"in betweens.\" It's a wonderful little story, but very understated. Bronson is great.","9360":"good movie.  I liked it a lot.  one of Bronson's best I think.","9361":"GREAT GROUP GREAT FUN. THE BEST","9362":"Kids said 4 thumbs up","9363":"My daughter is fifteen years old, but the other night, she just had an urge to watch this again. I believe, like all things Sesame Street, that Elmo in Grouchland has more and more meaning as we grow into adults. The big-name actors (we ADORE Mandy Patinkin!) the cultural humor that goes over the heads of the little children...this just never gets old. Elmo in Grouchland and Follow That Bird are the two Sesame Street films that will simply live forever.","9364":"My kids love this movie. Its cute and teaches them to share.","9365":"Excellent period piece.  Bronson & Coburn are great in the movie.","9366":"One of the greatest movies ever made !!","9367":"52 dollars for the bluray somebody is on drugs","9368":"This is one of my favorite films. It is also one of my favorite Charles Bronson films. I have it on VHS, but decided to get it in DVD. The DVD is of good audio and visual quality. Nothing new in the DVD that isn't in the VHS. No special features. Nada. Love the Nawlins location for this film that takes place during the depression.\nOverall, if you collecting DVDs of your favorite films, I'd recommend this one.","9369":"Very funny","9370":"very good movie","9371":"excellent","9372":"One of the best movies of all time!!!","9373":"Bronson's best movie, should be mentioned when talking about great fight movies","9374":"Classic Charles Bronson,Surprises abound,This is a must watch for any die-hard Bronson fan.","9375":"Great movie.  Have seen it before and wanted to watch it again.","9376":"This is an unusual movie, with Bronson's typically laconic lone ranger persona filling up the screen. Coburn is just right as the avaricious manager, living from bet to bet, and finding himself in some serious trouble. As a period piece, it has few rivals. Ireland's dilapidated one bedroom reeks of depression-era lodgings, as does Bronson's feral hunger.","9377":"Geat movie, Bronson is the type for this Walter Hill movie !!!!","9378":"Great!!","9380":"My two-year-old granddaughter is an Elmo fan, but found it scary. We watched the first part and then had to skip to the end so she knew Elmo would get his blanket back. Maybe for older kids...","9381":"Great movie.  And a great cast to boot..  Don't miss this one.","9382":"A great hard-scrabble bare-fisted fight film. Bronson is at his taciturn best, the Depression-era milieu is brilliantly expressed, and the characters are well-drawn and lively (see Coburn, James).","9383":"Love it when actors get into the a time period and really play the part good ...charles does that","9384":"good movie, been many years since first viewed.  enjoyed it more this time, especially James Coburn's part.","9385":"Epic movie.","9386":"Great movie with the Monty Python guys.","9387":"Funny classic film","9388":"Aaa","9389":"The best of the great Monty Python' movies.","9390":"I am happy with this order.","9391":"One of my favorite movies","9392":"This is a every family should have movie!","9393":"received as promised!  Good movie!","9394":"well acted for the genre","9395":"One of my all time favorite movies.  Doing what you have to do compared to dreaming about it.","9396":"It's Charles and James! Great movie!","9397":"Great old Charles Bronson Movie","9398":"This movie is the foundation for all street fighting films! All star cast! Classic!","9399":"Bronson movie!  If you like Bronson it's great!","9400":"Walter Hill's best movie.  Brilliant casting, perfect pace, south Louisiana and New Orleans scenery...\n\nYou won't be any smarter or better informed after watching, but you will be well entertained.","9401":"Very funny movie.","9402":"Excellent!","9403":"Super cute show. My 2 year old (who never settles down long enough to watch TV) and my 5 year old both enjoy this movie.","9404":"Good","9405":"A very funny movie.....","9406":"Nice addition","9407":"This is simply a great movie.","9408":"Monty python is louldly cheered or jeered. I am a strong follower. The Holy Grail is stillmost enjoyable everytime I watch it.","9409":"Love the movie, but the audio quality on this is terrible.  Cannot get enough volume out of it.","9410":"Great fun movie","9411":"ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES BRONSON MADE AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT.","9412":"Excellent movie! One of Charles Bronson best.","9413":"Simply great and timeless\n\nI have watched this many times over the years. It never fails to impress me. It is both stark yet full of life. I think it is a quiet look on human nature and how the people can be so involved in the same event but be motivated so differently.\n\nAll performances are outstanding.","9414":"Small movie with actual dialogue that starts out slow, but builds slowly to a crescendo.  The ending is not happy ever after, but in the great depression, that kind of thing was very uncommon.  The movie keeps your interest, and it doesn't try to make a statement, just makes for good entertainment instead.  I would advise anyone watching this to not except anything, but to be ready to just enjoy the movie no matter were it takes you.","9415":"My grandson and I thoroughly enjoyed it!","9416":"A+++","9417":"love this movie","9418":"classic Monty Python, a must have","9419":"What's not to like about Charles Bronson, James Coburn and Strother Martin? This early Walter Hill film, with some of the best fight scenes ever filmed, has as its serene center the fighter himself.","9420":"Great Bronson movie","9421":"I'd seen it a long time ago and it was still great seeing it again. Charles Bronson was in a class of a select few.","9422":"Charles was my hero. His movies were great and this one was even more so.","9423":"This movie is a classic, Bronson at his best. Sad that most of the cast is gone now but they will always be remembered.","9424":"no problems","9425":"kids love it really funny","9426":"Hard Times is an outstanding movie, with an outstanding cast: Charles Bronson, James Coburn, Strother Martin, Jill Ireland, and the great bit player, Robert Tessier. The fight scenes are exciting and realistic. The plot works.","9427":"I love this movie. Set in the middle of the Depression, it captures the mood wonderfully. All of the characters are well portrayed and believable. I would say this is a \"hard hitting\" hit, but that is too obvious.","9428":"Typical Charles Bronson movie.  A few uses of profanity that should have been left out.","9429":"bronson at his best -- not too much to say, but a lot of presence.","9430":"Great movie","9431":"My son didn't care for this and never finished watching it.","9432":"Kids love it, and I'm starting to know it by memory.","9433":"Great movie!  My grandson really liked it!!","9434":"It kept the kids occupied and had some good life lessons... what else can you ask for?","9436":"A solid intertaining movie of tested grit I can watch multi times, which I have.....","9437":"Saw this in a theatre back when it was first released!  It was great then and still is!","9438":"Bronson is convincing","9439":"Gory but funny.","9440":"What can I say...killer bunnies, farts in your general direction, coconut shells, gotta love Monty Python!","9441":"I have seen this several times and it is always a good watch.","9442":"Ok","9443":"Kids loved it. Please stock more kids fun products","9444":"Great movie","9445":"love Charles Bronson in this movie as well as James Coburn.  great movie and good interaction between them. if you like either one\nof these actors then watch the movie.  you'll enjoy it.","9446":"BRONSON IS THE MOVIE.PERIOD PIECE OF THE DEPRESSION GREATCAST,WELL ACTED","9447":"Loved the movie, loved the outro movie theme song - I wish they would publish it as played for the outro.","9448":"My 2 year old granddaughter loves it.","9449":"kids loved it !","9450":"One ok Charles Bronson's b\nest","9451":"Great movie need more older movies like this","9452":"My favorite Bronson film.","9453":"Excellent blu ray. Picture quality is ace and well worth buying.","9454":"Good movie...always enjoy Charles Bronson","9455":"Charles Bronson and Lee Marvin. Enough said.","9456":"Hard and gritty, Bronson at the top of his game.","9457":"It's a classic.  If you have never viewed it, do.","9458":"Unparalleled. A classic in comedy.","9459":"kind of silly-------would not buy it","9460":"Annoying!! My daughter loves this movie but I hate it. It drives me nuts. The acting is terrible (even for a kid's show) and it goes on forever. Better lessons on sharing and not being greedy have been taught in less than 20 minutes but this is a full length film. All the crazy stuff going on takes away from the actual message. The songs are horrible. But my daughter loves Elmo, so she loves it. That's really all this movie has going for it.","9461":"Great.  THANKS!","9462":"Classic, still funny","9463":"This is my favorite movie of three great actors! Bronson, Coburn, and Martin! I don't see how it could have been any better! AWESOME!","9464":"Bronson is an aging but stone tough bare-knuckles boxer during the Great Depression.  A loner, he teams with manager James Coburn and doctor Strother Martin to make some money in the illegal fight business.  He knocks down a number of competitors, and has a little romance with Jill Ireland (his real-life wife).\nVery evocative of the times, and who doesn't like to see Bronson hit people?  Great fun.","9465":"I loved this money the first time I saw it and I still love it.  Bronson is great.","9466":"This is pretty good, not overloaded with moral lessons, just good examples of how to be nice, and not be greedy.  Do not watch it with someone attached to a blanket though, it could be a little stressful!","9467":"Wonderful . My grandson and I love this movie.","9468":"Kept both my kids attention  -- 4 & 6.  We never watched Sesame Street but it was free so we checked it our on Prime.  They both loved it.  We watch all the time now.","9469":"Looks great, Thanks!","9470":"This is a classic. Everybody should watch this for a lot of laughs.","9471":"The first feature film from Python. Gotta love the Trojan rabbit!","9472":"one of the best movies of all time--heck of a show!!","9473":"thank you","9474":"My favorite Charles Bronson movie.","9475":"Another Classic Charles Bronson movie! Bare-knuckle fighting, gambling, back in the depression era. James Coburn hooks up with Bronson and manages him and gets himself into trouble! James Coburn does a great acting job and beautiful film work (in my opinion). If you are a Bronson fan, you'll like this movie!","9476":"Bought this for my Dad, he loved it.","9477":"A real sleeper.  Great movie.  One of his best","9478":"Perhaps, with the exception of the very first \"Death Wish\" movie (based on the Brian Garfield novel of the same title), this film is probably the VERY best of all of the Charles Bronson movies made, in my humble opinion. With a strong supporting cast incl. James Coburn, Strother Martin, & Jill Ireland (Bronson's real-life wife), this is one of those movies that most people would want as a permanent part of a good movie library - definitely a \"keeper\"...!!","9479":"Ok for an Elmo movie. Lots of sarcasm in the dialogue. Not my favorite in this series","9480":"son loved it","9481":"My first time seeing it on Blu-ray.  What a fun ride down memory lane.  This film is a baby boomer's must see.","9482":"asdf","9483":"Perfect","9484":"This is one of Bronson's best movies with a great supporting cast.  The testosterone is really pumping in this one and Charlie sets the standard for being in great physical condition when you start getting long in the tooth ... so I really have to be careful whenever I watch it ... because this old guy stops drinking beers and start doing pushups...  Enjoy it!  ;-)","9485":"INCREDIBLE QUALITY! It was a bit expensive but totally worth it! There were only 3,000 made. This is clearly from the master footage.","9486":"Always liked Bronson but this one was a classic period piece. Decent acting, very good fight scenes although strangely, the next to last fight was more intense than the final, supposedly climactic fight. That notwithstanding an extremely entertaining movie as long as you take it for what it was meant to be, an action flick with good fights and a taste for the depression era environment.","9487":"Quaint old fashioned movie.  Refreshing, enjoyable.  Well-done.  If this was a modern movie, Speedy would be wearing cement shoes and none of them would have got out with their money.  However this was back when this type of movie was allowed to have an OK ending, not just drenched in tragedy.","9488":"What can I say? My 18 month old granddaughter crawls up in my lap and snuggles up close and we watch Elmo!  And, \"No\", not every video has that affect on her - she just loves Elmo.  Kind of makes me glad I loaded up on the Tickle Me Elmo's back when they were a hot commodity.  The story line, graphics, music and every aspect of this movie are great.  Highly recommend.","9489":"One of the best movies of all time!","9490":"This is a classic which everyone who loves edgy humor should have.","9491":"A classic. One of the most absurdly stupid-funny movies of all time.","9492":"EPIC","9493":"Great Buy!!!","9495":"I watched this with my 5 year old and he liked it but I think this is really geared toward a slightly younger audience. It was ok just nothing I was too excited about.","9497":"Super classic. One of the funniest movies I've seen. Up there with Caddy shack, Vacation & Blazing Saddles.","9498":"classic","9499":"good","9500":"Great movie","9501":"Love seeing my favorite characters in action  such as \"Grouch\",.","9502":"My 2 year old great grandson loves Elmo. He watches this one everyone he comes to my house. He is so involved with it that he will take his blanket over to the TV and say, \"here Elmo.\"\nIt's a very good lesson for this age group about mine and sharing.","9503":"Classic performances by Bronson, Coburn and Strother Martin.  Great sets and locations.","9504":"A story that touches your heart and soul...love Charles Bronsons acting...love boxing!","9505":"1st. time I saw it. I loved it.","9506":"My granddaughter is a big \"Elmo\" fan (but then, whose isn't).  We've watched this video several times and she never seems to tire of it.","9507":"My granddaughter loves it","9508":"What's there to say, this is a comedy classic brought to you by the geniuses of Monty Python. Endlessly quoteable and timelessly hysterical. A must own.","9509":"It's Monty Python. A classic for a good reason. Funny and sharp ... silly and profound.","9510":"How do the words of a mere mortal properly rate a classic?","9511":"I only first saw this a few years ago, but watching it again reminded me how much I loved it. Absolutely hilarious!!","9512":"OK","9514":"Absolutely a great movie with great actors.","9515":"When Elmo falls into grouchland, I think it's the funniest part in the movie. I love this movie. I love you, Elmo.","9516":"Kids liked it so I'm happy.","9517":"A must for the Monty Python fan, actually it's a must for everyone. So buy it and feel better about your life for doing so.","9518":"It came on time with no problems.","9519":"Easily, I think, Bronson's best movie. Don't really understand why more people haven't seen and really enjoyed it. If nothing else, the 1920's New Orleans ambiance is worth the time. The ending is so feel-good, I get antsy waiting for it. (\"Let's go get the cat.\")","9520":"Great movie!","9521":"I really loved this movie. Charles Bronson and James Coburn are great actors. All aduslts will enjoy this movie. I highly recommend it. It has bee a long time coming to Blu-ray.","9522":"Bronson at his middle-aged best.  He & Coburn go together like beer & pizza.  It's a hard-knuckled punch-fest with great character and a beautifully rendered depression-era New Orleans - just marvelous to watch.  The transfer to Blu Ray is immaculate - I can only hope other Charles Bronson classics such as Chato's Land & The Mechanic get the same Blu Ray treatment when officially released.","9524":"Georgeus and funny","9525":"I can watch this over and over again!","9526":"Thank you Monty Python for taking me \"out of this world\" and making me laugh.","9527":"One of Bronson's better pictures. If you like MMA, you will like this picture.","9528":"Very good transfer of this 1970s' movie.\nMovie looks good.","9529":"it ok","9530":"A+","9531":"Simply stated - these type of movies are not made anymore....\n\nThe cast shines, especially Bronson and Coburn; besides The Magnificent Seven, Hard Times are the top three movies for Bronson with us\n\nSet in the Depression era of American Mid-West, the main character ( a drifter) is a hard hitting man on and off the ring.  He is a simple man, with simple but proven rules and great character.","9532":"This is my favorite Bronson movie!  I loved seeing this movie in widescreen Blu-Ray (at last).  The pan and scan DVD was all that was available until now and was a disappointment.  The only knock is the limited edition price of nearly $50!  Some extra features like a \"making of\" documentary or deleted scenes would also have been nice.","9533":"My mother loves this movie, however only had the movie on VHS. It was time to go with DVD. She enjoyed this more clear version and will always consider this one of Charles Bronson's best.","9534":"This is my favorite CB movie.  I just had to get the blu ray version for years of clear viewing enjoyment.  Now all I need is Jan Michael Vincent, White Line Fever in blu ray and I'm set.","9535":"One for the collection. Good seller.\nIf you like Bronson movies you will like this one. It is a must for your collection. A lot of great talent,\nsadly no longer with us, play their roles to the bone.","9537":"It was a gift.  they like it a lot","9538":"Always a favorite in this household","9539":"My nieces (3 & 5) loved it.\nThey thought it was soo funny.","9540":"one of the greatest comedies (probably the best british comedy ever) and a must have for any movie collector","9541":"pretty good,,,I somehow expected more","9542":"Love it.","9543":"funny","9544":"Another old favororite of mine, where its a grest pleasure to see real ACTORS  doing thier best....everyone in the prime of thier film careers...proof always that a game of tennis or a boxing match against your betters , makes yu climb higher...top movie entertainment...dont miss it","9545":"Great period piece of honky tonk Louisiana.  Bronson, cool, tough, great shape.  Good fight scenes.  Has special memories watching in in movies in mountains of Colorado when it first came out.","9546":"a great movie for the man cave, you will not be disappointed, and I would  highly recommend it to anyone.","9547":"Great cast, good story, what more do you want from a movie. Good action, some damn good fights. Enjoy it","9548":"Enjoyed this.  Like the title says and during these times it was \"Hard Times.  Many people made a living as best they could.","9549":"A very well done underated fairly accurate period piece. This movie gives gives the viewer a gilimpse of life during the depression.","9550":"Once and a while there is a movie that comes by, that hold's its age for decades to come. The sound \/picture \/ location and acting; Are so well done -it captures your attention even now. Charles Bronson made many films, this by far his best (with his wife) and the Magnificent 7 his second best - the rest, well that's for his kids to decide.","9551":"My God daughter loved it! It was fun..","9552":"I really love Elmo and Sesame street. But this movie is unsafe for a 2 year old. My baby loves Elmo. There is a scene with an objectified woman who dances curvy silhouette dance while Elmo looks at her mesmerised. Inappropriate. Do not recommend.","9554":"This movie features Charles Bronson in one of his Very best performances. It also has wonderful support from James Coburn and Strother Martin. A must for fans of action films","9555":"I was expecting more and disappointed. One could sum up this movie in one sentence \"tough guy wins some fights\". Also, it is sort of hard to buy as Charles Bronson is old and the other fighters were just as old. I won't watch this again, in my opinion not worth watching.","9556":"A Bargain.","9557":"One of the best movies ever. Top ten favorite.","9558":"Love Monty Python and Holy Grail is a timeless classic.  We are forever quoting this movie.  Two thumbs up.","9559":"I purchased this for my son and grandson as a Christmas gift.  My grandson is only 4 years old, so he's a little young for the movie, but he loves the castle and catapult.  One of these days, I know they will watch the movie together, and I'm sure he will love it as much as his daddy does.","9560":"Cute movie awesome for kids and adults.","9561":"great collectable packaging grat extras!!!","9562":"Love this movie. So funny!","9563":"Great movie","9564":"Disc and packaging were brand new. No scratches or damage of any kind. Perfect.","9565":"A great film from a time when great acting and a good story were all it took to make awesome movies. I think it was Charles Bronson's best work but Struther Martin and James Coburn really made it one of those movies that \"stick with you\" for some reason that's difficult to understand. It wasn't complex, unusual for the period or otherwise stood out but just \"worked\".","9566":"Walter Hill, Charles Bronson & James Coburn. These are the story of the film. Many good boxing and fightings. Excellent period pictures. Bronson is the best of the movie. Ring the bell and box.","9568":"Excellent movie, hard to find and worth the investment. Excellent addition to the collection. I am still looking for other Charles Bronson necessary collection movies.  But I am a patient person. :)","9570":"Best kids movie","9571":"Keeps my 18 month old entertained and Is very educational.","9572":"great","9573":"Monty Python's best work.","9574":"Classic comedy","9575":"Classic movie and for the price, I had to buy it so that I could relive watching this from my childhood. Glad I did. I don't think bluray would enhance the quality of this film's picture very much, so I went with the DVD.","9576":"although this is a limited release,it is a must have for Bronson fans.previous version was a full screen sham,and this Blu-ray is wonderfully done in widescreen format.you will want this in your Blu-ray collection. Highly recommended!","9578":"Great movie, a must see and you can't beat the price!","9579":"Great item; excellent packaging; fast shipper.  A++++","9580":"There was something wrong with the programming when this one was manufactured.  Kept repeating and never ever got to the end.  A glitch that kept on happening. Very frustrating.  Peed me off big time for an evening.","9581":"Well, the only reason I can imagine you are reading this is if you did not grow up in an Engliish-speaking land or that you were born yesterday. I am reviewing it on the occasion of receiving the most recent of many DVD's that have been given away or lost through the years. It marks my age, but in college, people would fill entire weekends with recounting the movie lines from memory  (of course with a little help from our friends).","9582":"Awesome awesome movie great for all ages a must watch","9583":"Way too hectic for little children.  Lots of extraneous noise.  Very frantic pace.  Would not recommend.  Muppets movies much better.","9584":"Great! This was done perfectly. It reflected the times, the people and the locale. I have watched this many times. One of my favorites.","9586":"One of Charles Bronsons' best films ever! If you're a Bronson fan, you must add this one to your collection!","9587":"this movie now looks fab on bluray its that good that it look,s like it was shot this year, the print is great and colourfull very sharp and the new sound is brill too with a dts 5,1 score, if your a fan of the bronson movie,s this has got to be one for your shelf 10 out of 10 fab.","9588":"I love this movie and this Blu-Ray version of the movie worth the price I paid for it. I had bought a DVD version of the movie but it was in full screen and not worth owning.","9589":"Probably the best film Charles Bronson ever did.  A Walter Hill directed film and it is a good one. Gives a great picture of the Depression Era.  The role played by his manager.  (sorry forgot his name) is a classic.  I saw this when it first came out many years ago and still like it today.","9591":"Cute movie...I put it on for my 13-month old nephew and it kept his attention for 3\/4 of the movie (impressive)!  The characters and songs were great.","9592":"What's not to like about this movie? I'm a huge Monty Python fan and this movie almost completed my collection!","9593":"This movie feels like the writer had Mr. Bronson in mind for this part; when he wrote it. The quiet street smart Chaney is all Bronson. Strother Martin, James Coburn and Jill Ireland were also very good. Coburn is a natural as fight promoter\/gambler - Speed.","9598":"Charles Bronson has a particular quality about his acting.  This film has a number of great fights(fake or not) in the film.  Would watch it over and over.","9599":"Bronson was the Clint Eastwood of street fighters-Doesn't talk,just gets it done, in style!  Goes to work,,wins,and  moves on\ndown the tracks.","9600":"Great movie","9601":"My kids absolutely love this movie! We watch it almost every day. We love the songs and the message is great!","9602":"best movie ever","9603":"Hilarious.  My sons and I have quoted this movie for years.  Hilarious.","9604":"Great fun! Kudos to whoever dreamt up the packaging with catapult & plastic farm animals.","9605":"Terrible.  Rude.  Crass.  Worst part is when I opened the packaging, a M00se bit my sister.","9606":"This is a real great movie and Bronson's best without a doubt. James Coburn almost steals the show from Bronson as a fast talking hustler Speed who pairs up with Bronson as his manager to make big money through street fighting. Bronson is an older man but a tough fighter. Bronson faces a lot of tough guys in fights. Bronson's real life wife appears in the film as his love interest. Strother Martin appears as the cut man who has a weakness for Opium. Great lost gem.","9608":"Although one would have to have totally invulnerable knuckles and hand bones to do these fights in real life (as a doorman in the 70s I broke them three times hitting skullbone), this is Bronsons best, lean dialogue, \"just the money\".","9609":"the standard...","9610":"It's Monty Python, what's not to love?","9611":"GREAT CLASSIC MOVIE!! LOVE IT!!","9612":"Perfect!  Thank you!","9613":"My 3 year old loves it!","9617":"One of my favorite movies.  Fight action, acting, and story are good.  One to have in the collection.  Charles bronson is a street fighter who teams up with Strother Martin and James Coburn.  You can't go wrong with this movie.","9621":"My son loooooves this movie!","9622":"My son loves it! Watches it all your time. Worth it!","9623":"This is a cute film featuring your favorite Sesame Street characters. Mandy Patinkin is great and he pulls off some great expressions as the \"villain\" of the movie. Don't expect life-changing plot twists or super action here, but this is a good kids film with some fun settings and characters and a lot of clever puns and jokes focusing on the backwards nature of Grouchland.\n\nThe disc is in a simple DVD case, and considering the price, the packaging is more than appropriate.","9624":"ome of the best Elmo movies ever","9625":"Great DVD.  Thank you.","9626":"My 12 year old son loved it. He laughed!!","9627":"great gift","9628":"If you like action movies with good old fasioned streetfighting this is your movie. Movie arrived in just over a week, in great condition.","9631":"Wish a reivew had alerted me, but I should have checked the aspect ratio before purchase anyway. The movie is pan and scan other than the credits. A real rip-off. I'm not waiting to rate the movie, guess I'll do that whenever I get to SEE the whole thing. Whatever the strengths of the movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD PRODUCT.","9633":"Grandchildren love it!","9634":"Love elmo","9635":"Squeeeeee!","9636":"Still good for those of us who are twisted!","9637":"Great product","9638":"It is Monty Python, what else can you say! Really enjoyed the extra part where Michael Palin toured the places they filmed with some of the old crew.","9639":"OK, the Catapult was not as strong as shown in the video with the pythons and really took aim and work to get it to go over 2 feet\n\nStill, for the sake of having it, it is kinda cool","9641":"Great film about personal honor and the warrior spirit -- in a world where no one else exhibits any. The fighter does what he has to do, what he can do -- as well as he can, as long as he can, willing to sacrifice what he must to succeed. This is warrior spirit and personal honor, which can also be seen in \"The thirteenth Warrior,\" another much misunderstood film. Now that hard times are upon us, more of us should be watching movies like this for inspiration!","9645":"The presentation of this package is outstanding - with one small caveat.  Upon opening this edition - i was compelled to put all of the small barnyard animals into my mouth - to test this so called \"choking hazard\".  This resulted in nothing more than very wet toys.  I shall have to content myself with merely launching them at the damnable cat.","9647":"This is good. I am not a huge fan of Elmo but my kid likes him.","9648":"My grandson's first word \"ELMO\". He loves to watch the show.","9649":"grand son hated this dvd. i guess elmo is played out now.","9654":"Yes, this is arguably the best Charles Bronson film. This movie has great fight scenes considering the fact that it was created over 30 years ago and Colburn is great.","9655":"My granddaughters Love it","9656":"I know it was funny sometimes you see things one way & then something happens & the whole world looks totally different.","9657":"My son loves it!","9658":"Ok so yes this movie is old.... Would wish they would make the graphics more vivid more hd wise... Other than that my kids loved it.... Throwback 80's... Something to have in you're collection of kids movies...","9659":"My daughter loves Elmo and absolutely loves this movie. We have most definitely gotten our moneys worth out of this dvd.","9660":"I do not remember the movie being this funny, good quality transfer; have not played with the catapult yet.","9661":"If you don't own this movie, buy it. If  you don't watch it, at least have it.\n\nIf you don't buy it, I'll send the rabbit after you.","9668":"Still as funny as the first time I saw it.","9669":"Beyond funny!","9670":"If u need to know what a sense of humor or a comedy is then this is THE BEST movie for u.  I know Monty Python from the beginning so that means I am old.  However, after heavy persuasion I finally got my 20 something nephews to watch it.  mAny sister knew of Monty Python and all were transfixed, even thanked me!!!!!  . Could NOT EVEN believe they thanked me.  That was a good night and memory.  I am so glad to have it.  I even had \"I'm a lumberjack \" as a ringtone on the cell.","9671":"An old favorite which had been loaned out, but never returned. We reordered after our visit to Doune Castle, Scotland where this movie was made and had to watch it again. All the extras made it more fun, especially the Sing-a-longs!","9672":"Loved this movie growing up and still love it now. Does look nice on blu ray.","9673":"My son is a huge Elmo fan but this movie did not hold his attention.  After reading the reviews I just figured my son would be captivated. It now collects dust with all the other movies my son has rejected.","9674":"my 3 year old watches this over and over. this is one of her favorite movies and has a good plot. she is learning and having fun at the same time.","9675":"What child wouldn't like Sesame Street characters?  Eight month old loves watching it.  It has lots of bright colors.  She loves it.","9681":"Really, what else can I say about one of the funniest movies ever made? If you're not worried about extra special features, grab this version as cheap as you can.","9682":"great","9683":"Hilarious.","9684":"I watched this movie when it was first introduce so many times. Had my first cable TV so it was repeated again and again. You might think that I would not want to see it again but I could watch it again. Monty Python did a good thing for comedy with this movie.  I know that some people do not like the British humor but it is probably rooted in my British ancestors. For me good entertainment.","9688":"For anyone who loves Coburn\/Bronson, great direction, stylistic cinematography or period films, this is it.  I was oh-so impressed with how great this movie looks in 2.35 widescreen.  Great transfer and a great price!!  The ending was a bit anti-climatic, but this disc is definately staying in the collection.  They don't make 'em like James Coburn or Charles Bronson anymore.......","9690":"Unless you use Amazon Prime shipping will be expensive.  Cows are heavy and rather flatulent beasts. We lost 3 cows during testing.","9691":"Product as described","9692":"Great Movie especially on Blu Ray","9693":"The best of the best!","9694":"This is a fun movie and they didn't take themselves too seriously when making it.  I find when watching this in older versions backing things up just to see particular scenes over again, or remembering my initial reactions as the outright silliness that they brought forth.  A fun movie to watch and have when life just gets too serious.  The only issue is it a catapult or was it a cowtapult?  I've seen so much weird stuff in my time sometimes things blur together a bit.","9695":"I liked it and the kids (3 and 5) liked it too.. its funny.  My 3 year son was a little scared watching it the first time.. We watched it again and he was fine with it.","9697":"great movie","9698":"Great Elmo movie bought it for my Nephew I think he only like all of the musical part of the movie! Gotta love ELMO! I recommend this to anyone the have children age 9 and under its very entertaining and educational!","9699":"You an't go wrong with muppets. Great grandchildren are enthralled by the colors, music and characters. I don't have to worry about inappropriate materials within the movie.","9700":"My son loves this movie. I can't say I do because I'm not necessarily a fan. But my son sure loves Elmo and this movie gives him constant Elmo rather than brown up bits in Sesame Street.","9701":"Enjoyable for all! This is a fun story of Elmo's blankie.  My son loves his blankie so this movie was great fun!","9702":"This movie was a good movie for youngsters as our grandson loved every minute of it. He's only 18 months old. I think the bright colors attract kids.","9703":"They are so cute which good and funny movie for my kids, tape is in good condition. My kids have both in VHS & DVD too. Thank you very much & have a good day!!","9704":"Classic! Every Montes Python fan should own. Their best movie. Funny stuff.","9705":"Funny.  My side is sore from laughing so much!","9706":"This is a classic comedy. You can't help but belly laugh all through it.","9707":"...classic!!!","9708":"Not as bad as The meaning of life, but not very funny. Just dumb.","9709":"It's a Kid's movie and my son like it. It made my son stop a monkey role and stay to watch.","9710":"I have to say, I do love that Elmo. However, there were parts of this adventure that scared my 2 year old nephew. Not too thrilled with that. It was very well made though. Maybe it would be better for older kiddos.","9711":"Hilarious movie if you like this type of humor.","9712":"Great movie.","9713":"Love this movie. Came new and wrapped. Lots of extras. Happy.","9714":"What can be said of the genius that is Monty Python. brilliant!!!!! What a classic!!!!","9715":"Love this movie!","9716":"Love the movie! Monty Python Troop is hilarious! Get your copies of the troops movies!","9717":"came on time & my grandson loves this movie.it's one of his favorites. he loves anything with elmo any of the sesame st. characters.","9718":"My daughter loves Elmo, so we picked this movie for her to watch. She sat through the whole movie! She really loved it.","9719":"A old time favor movie","9720":"Great classic movie - glad to have it on DVD.","9721":"My 2 yo granddaughter just loves this movie.  Every Sunday she climbs in my desk chair to watch it on my desktop.  As soon as she walks in the house she says \"Elmo\"?  Keep up the good work.\n\nBarbara","9722":"My 23 month old son loves this movie. The movie is mainly revolving around Elmo's blue blanket, and my son also has a beloved blue blanket. The characters do a lot of interacting with the audience.","9723":"I thought it would be cute but all my children were frightened. beets me. If you have older kids or kids that are more used to scary things I am sure it would be fine.","9724":"Funny as I expect from Python. I'll be getting more of their stuff.","9725":"Watched it again after 20 some years, one real laugh and a few chuckles","9726":"A true comedic masterpiece. I first saw the movie when I was 8 and laughed just a bit. Now that I'm 24 I can really appreciate all of the humor involved from the politics to the sheer absurd shenanigans that happen. The movie itself is what you'd expect from a bluray remaster. Looks good, sounds good and plays with no problems.","9727":"Classic Python! Hard to imagine it has been 30 YEARS!","9728":"IT'S A NICE FAMILY MOVIE. TIME FOR A NEW ELMO MOVIE. A MUST SEE. IS ELMO UP FOR ANOTHER CUDDLY BUDDY MOVIE?","9729":"My son lives watching elmo and at times I catch myself watching it and liking it too. It reminds me of bring a kid watching sesame street.","9730":"This never gets old.","9731":"A MOST EXCELLENT ADVENTURE","9732":"Great item!!","9733":"I purchased this for my three year old niece. It's one of her favorite shows. The song with Vanessa Williams rocks.","9734":"A classic. One of the funniest movies ever made. Warning: Doesn't mix well with women! They just don't get it.","9735":"a family favorite","9736":"Was first video cassette I ever bought still as good today as then.","9737":"Very entertaining and kept my 3 and 1 1\/2 year olds captivated. It is also helpful in teaching about sharing, as well as perseverance and believing you can do something when you put your mind to it.  I use the \"You don't want to be like Huxley, do you?\" line any time my son refuses to share with his little brother. We watch this regularly:)","9739":"Regardless of the recent events with Mr. Clash, Elmo is still a household name in our home. My daughter dances to the songs and frequently requests the \"Elmo movie!\"  I'll admit, I find myself getting into it too!  Cute story and well done.","9740":"Every time this movie came on TV, I would drop everything to watch it again and again.\n\nYou'll fall out of your seat laughing.","9741":"Such a good movie, one of my all time favorites, it's such a classic.","9742":"none","9743":"Nothing can be added to the accolades this film has received so it's pointless to expound.","9744":"Or anywhere!\nThis should be required study for Social Science, Art, History, and Religions in High School.\nThis is another work I have owned in several formats over the decades.\nYes, I CAN sing along with the \"Camelot\" song!","9745":"My boys loved this movie when they were younger!! It instantly became their #1 favorite movie, we have watched it MANY MANY times, Elmo is cute and lovable, it has great sing-along music, the colors are bright and its very entertaining! My husband even liked it and would go to work singing the songs until he got teased one day - LOL. Very cute movie!","9746":"Little fans of Elmo will enjoy this movie. Elmo loves his blanket and wants it all to himself. He gets separated from it and then pursues his blanket into Grouchland where he encounters selfish Huxley who also loves Elmo's blanket. According to Huxley, the blanket is \"mine\"! Elmo is persistent in this adventure to get his beloved blanket back and learns a thing or two about sharing.","9747":"bad movie idea.  not great like the elmo show on sesame street.  should have never been made. don't buy!","9748":"As silly as I remembered.  The one liners are awesome.  I find I have aged since seeing this last.","9749":"Pythons classic","9750":"My 20 month old LOVES this video and so do I.  My husband and I have laughed at many things from this video, they have done a really good job.  You must get this one for your collection, you kids will watch from the beginning all the way to the end and that is no small thing.  :)","9751":"old favorite and still is","9752":"A classic movie with great quotes. Everyone needs to see this at least once. It's just a flesh wound!","9753":"great","9756":"Unfortunately I lost the taste for old British humor and it doesn't appeal to me in 2015 as it did in early 1970s","9757":"Good movie, what more can you say","9758":"Nice item.  Recommended.  Thanks.","9759":"Classic! Must have!","9760":"Family favorite","9761":"Elmo learns about sharing and perseverance when his blanket gets swiped by the villainous Huxley in Grouchland. This DVD is great fun with plenty of little jokes to keep the parents entertained, too.","9762":"Classic!","9763":"always fun to watch","9764":"I enjoyed this dvd more that my daughter did.  She was 1 when we first watched it.  It did not keep her attention.  She prefers the Elmo dvds with a lot of singing and dancing.  I still bring it out once and while and as she gets older, she pays more attention to it.\n\nAs always with a Sesame Street dvd, there are great lessons.  I think this is a great movie for a three year old child or older.","9765":"When your kids get above 10, you have to share this with them.  No, it's not entirely family friendly but demented and perfect to enjoy with your teenagers.","9766":"One of the \"Holy Grails\" of comedy.","9767":"Love it. Get it. But! British comedy is a lil different","9768":"It's a classic, what else you want to know?","9769":"I own many Sesame Street DVDs.  This one is good, but there are better ones out there.  On the plus side, my 23 month old loves it and it entertains her.  Another plus is that it teaches the concept of sharing and friendship.  I gave it three stars because there are Sesame Street DVDs that I actually enjoy better and they are just as appealing to my daughter.  I would suggest \"Elmo's Sing Along Guessing Game\", or \"Sesame Streets 25th Birthday Musical Celebration\".","9771":"I got this movie for my son and he loved it.  I found it to be a little disgusting, but it entertained him so much.  Elmo is looking for his blanket in Oscar's trash can and he gets sucked away to Grouchland.  He learns that he can do what he puts his mind to....getting back his blankie.","9773":"Great.","9776":"I AM WRIGHTING THIS FOR MY BROTHER,TANNER.HE WATHED THIS MOVIE 7 TIMES THE FIRST DAY HE GOT IT!HE`S A BIG ELMO FAN AND THIS IS HIS FAVORETE ONE!HE LOVES THIS MOVIE AND I KINDAVE LIKE IT TO!","9777":"FAST DELIVERY!  VERY SATISFIED!  THANKS!","9778":"awesome classical funny movie,","9779":"Loved it","9780":"The disc is shiny and pretty.  I like it's perfect roundness also.  I put it in a DVD player and it withstood well being spun.  The containing box has some nice colors, fonts, and imagery, and hold the DVD perfectly.  Overall, I'm pleased!","9785":"I can only say that my 14 month old nephew was enthralled by this film...and I found it entertaining as well. Very nicely done! Mandy Patinkin steals the show, and Vanessa Williams little musical number stopped it! Bravo!","9786":"Husband loves this movie","9787":"A+","9788":"So hilarious!!","9789":"FUN!!!","9792":"very very funny...a must have","9793":"My son enjoyed this also. It was a Christmas present.

Shipping was on time, package was in good condition, very happy.","9805":"LAUGHED MY BUTT OFF!!  The black knight?  FUNNY!!  The 'killer rabbit'?  FUNNIER STILL!!!  S & T to be certain and not for young children.  Teenagers would probably like it though.","9806":"Been looking for this for a long time. english humor is the best.","9807":"Fantastic!","9808":"Still fun after all these years.","9809":"exbfbuy","9810":"This was a lot funnier when I was a stupid kid.","9811":"THIS COMES IN 3RD, BEHIND THE MEANING OF LIFE (1ST), AND LIFE OF BRIAN, STILL GOOD, THOUGH.  IT'S JUST THAT THE RIDING AROUND W\/O HORSE GETS OLD QUICK, FOR ME...I STILL LIKE IT.","9812":"Insanely funny","9813":"Has there ever been a funnier movie?  I don't think so.","9814":"As described.","9815":"This movie sucked it was not funny. Some may enjoy this I didn't.","9816":"Ditto the great Python","9817":"classic","9818":"This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  He was delighted with the movie.  I was delighted with the price.  The sellers shipped the item to me well before Christmas.  They did a great job.","9819":"Love it!","9820":"The best of the Python movies...everyone should own a copy","9821":"Great stuff so much fun.","9822":"Funny","9823":"AAA+ Fast shipping","9824":"this was from a show I used to watch when I was younger . a nice addition to my dvd collection .","9827":"funny","9828":"for all monty python fans","9830":"Fast shipping, item as described!","9831":"Great. Kids love it.","9832":"It was great.","9833":"Classic","9834":"This movie I swear its just gold if you hate this moment then you really are mad then. Makes me laugh everytime I watch it.","9835":"Always a favorite and this was a great copy.","9836":"Best quality home release for this movie ever. I love Python, and this movie is my favorite of theirs.","9838":"Python one of the best comical troops of all time","9839":"My grandson had seen MONTY PYTHON in bits and pieces, but I gave him the DVD for his birthday, and he lit up more than his candles!  Since he appreciates off the wall humor, he loves it.  Some of his friends just don't get it.","9840":":)  :)  :)","9841":"funny","9842":"hysterical","9843":"good copy.","9844":"Best movie ever. If you haven't seen it, you must.","9845":"No issues with the DVD and received it in a timely manner","9846":"Great to see in Blu-ray","9847":"classic Python","9848":"Very funny stuff - if you are a Python fan.","9849":"One of the best comedies of all time.","9850":"Really loved it.","9852":"wonderful movie. instant classic. 5 stars...","9853":"A classic. If you have a dry sense of humor and a brain (you have to be able to keep up!!!) you'll love this. Don't know how many times I've watched this over the years (yes, on vhs too) but it always makes me smile and even my 20 something son gets it and enjoys it.","9855":"Awesome","9856":"Movie","9857":"A must for Monty Python Fans!","9859":"one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  And everyone I have every showed it to said they hated it, but within a month They want to see it again, or they have their own, and are running around quoting the movie.","9860":"EXCELLENT!!","9861":"Monty Python!!! If you don't know the Holy Grail then \"I will spit in your general direction\"! Funny each time I watch it.","9862":"They made this hysterical movie unavailable and I'm sure we all miss it greatly.\nNext time it becomes available, I'm going to buy it!!!","9863":"The is a very funny video seen the live play and had to get the movie it's funny get it","9864":"Always have loved this movie. It's incredibly quotable and so hilarious. I highly recommend getting and, if you've never seen it befre - where the hell have you ben\/","9865":"What more can I say. It's Monty Python and it's funny. What makes it even funnier is the people doing the acting don't seem to recognize how off the wall they are being. It's gut wrenching funny.","9866":"Like all the other Pythons, this one is very funny and enjoyable. Always a good laugh when watching it. Enjoy","9867":"I'd even call it a cult classic!  We originally saw this movie on BBC many years ago and our kids grew up loving it, now are teaching their spouses to love it too.  A Monty Python Gem, get it= you won't be sorry! ALWAYS buy at smile.amazon.com and support Your favorite Charity!","9868":"Who, besides my wife, doesn't love this movie.  Watched it with my 3 kids, ages 9-15 after receiving and there was much rejoicing.  Classic British comedy that is mostly kid friendly.  So many classic bits rolled into a comedic masterpiece.","9869":"Sounds great, looks great, funny, sad, simply really good quality and well for the price it just works great. Thank you very much.","9870":"Do I really need to explain this to you? It is Monty Python... What else do I really need to say?","9871":"This is a fun entertaining movie. Great alternative uses for Coconuts. If you have not watched yet please do if only for the help with Bird identification.","9872":"This is the best movie in the Monty Python set.  I have seen it multiple times, and find myself laughing out loud before some of the scenes even start.","9873":"It's hard to find a comedy troupe that was as classically funny as Monty Python.  The Holy Grail was the team at their finest.  Pure hilarity.","9874":"I admit it I like this movie so much that I have to buy replacements when I give the current library copy away.  The last one went to Romania with a conference attendee who had never heard of Monty Python.  When I loaned it to him he offered to buy my copy and I gave it to him.  I hope he gets it into the country.","9875":"If you play the Montey Python version of Fluxx this is a must see movie.  It is funny and at time very silly, but filled with many quotable parts from the knights of nee  to the very large bunny ow was it a Hare.","9876":"You haven't experienced this film and truly appreciated their pure genius until you have watched it with the Japanese dialogue track.  Nothing like a little Knights of Ni in Japanese!","9877":"Great movie. Monty Pythos's best, I think. I love British humor. The best part is the French guy telling them off.","9878":"Everyone gushes about the movie so I'm gonna stick to hardware. It arrived promptly and with no complications, the second I put the movie in my PS3 I was laughing. The special features are a real treat, particularly learning how to use coconut halves to simulate horseback riding. All in all, a great movie at a great price.","9880":"The rating is a 4 star because I watched the movie more than one time and liked it both times. However, I have to rewind and listen more than once because of poor hearing. The words speak a thousand pictures. I laughed lots. It would be considered a stupid movie by many but lighten up and it is wonderful","9881":"Great video. As are all the Monty Python videos, Have enjoyed these guys humor since they first hit air ways many years ago.","9882":"Who hasn't seen this movie? It is a must see for everyone. It is fun and never boring. Will spur conversation.","9883":"This is a classic of my younger years and when I saw it on Amazon video, I decided I should rent it.  It's a pleasant but corny and dated movie, but it was still good.  My 15 year old son watched and thought it was good.  So... decades after it was made it can appeal to all ages, but it's not as over the top funny as when  I saw it long ago.","9884":"I'm really not into the Monty Python scene but I really have come to be a big fan of The Holy Grail movie.  It's hilarious.","9885":"What else can you say about Monty Python?  This is just one of his movies that deal with utter  nonsense but it is probably the funniest.  There's no real plot, but a lot of sight gags and slapstick.  Geared more for adult audiences because of it's inane humor, but good for a real fun time.","9886":"I found this on Youtube and laughed the entire time. After getting tired of watching it on my computer screen, I bought the DVD. It was just as funny as the first time I watched it. Love it!","9887":"There are so many great lines in this movie, watch it so you know what others around you are talking about (like the killer rabbit).","9888":"this was a gift the person who rec'd it was a big fan of monty python, he is looking to purchase more","9889":"Can't help it.  One is either  a Monty Python fan or not.  Have at one time or another memorized several scenes\/monologues\nfrom this film.  There's no use saying anything good or bad about the movie.  Like I said you either like Monty Python or not.\nThanks.","9890":"Always a great movie. Picture quality isn't the best but I guess there's only so much they can do to fix that.","9892":"one of my favorites of all time.  this movie brings back memories and well as continuing to tickle me as I watch it again and again","9893":"It's Monty Python, what else needs to be said, the best of the best in my opinion, you have to have this in your collection","9894":"Great and classic comedy film. A must see for any who love comedy. One of the best of all time.","9895":"What is your name?\nWhat is your quest?\nWhat is the capitol of Constantinople?\nThis film is so much fun.","9896":"A good flik for \"remembering\" & refreshing watching. Thought Ihad - looked - looked - looked - \"Nope\" - so ordered & now do !","9897":"Who doesn't love Monty Python's Holy Grail?  It's a classic.  I don't normally buy movies, but this one I had to have.","9898":"Love this movie.  When we lost our original in the tornado, this was one of the first ones we replaced.","9899":"I have purchased this movie in multiple formats and now I have added it to my DVD collection.  This is a timeless classic.","9900":"Famous last words of the Black Knight guarding bridge over the creek. The best part of the DVD is the English subtitles. Having seen the flick repeatedly at dollar theatres, by turning on the English subtitles I was finally able to make out the lyrics to Knights of the Round table. It doesn't get any better for a Python fan, except maybe in Life of Brian. I know you hate me for saying such a thing, all of you Grailers.","9902":"had scene it years ago, still just as funny and stupid, still laughed at bunches of stuff, still good dry british humor","9903":"One of my all time favorite movies and it was great in blu ray format. A must have for any fan.","9904":"If you haven't watched this movie, you've been living under a rock for most of your life. British comedy at it's best. Family favorite.","9905":"I had forgotten all the visuals that are a part of a \"film\"  Things that a modern audience will not understand.  Still it is a classic and a must see.","9906":"If you know anything about Monty Python and you like british humor, this movie is a MUST see. Funniest python movie ever in my opinion. The stupidness will keep you laughing the whole movie.","9907":"That is all I know to say! Hahaha! My adult kids love this movie! Maybe I'm too old to understand it... But it's funny and weird all at the same time.","9908":"What kind of a review do you need, African or European? I suppose I could attach a small string under the dorsal guiding...","9909":"This movie has a lot of dry humor. Very low budget props but full of ridiculous antics that will keep you laughing.","9911":"This is should be part of a start kit for comedy and fantasy films. It is so stupid you cant help but laugh. Half the time it makes no sense at all, that is what makes it so funny.","9912":"The movie needs more work with its weak plot and confussing theme but the charaters are great and location ok","9914":"This movie is either love or hate.  Good thing I love it.  The dry sense of humor and slapstick comedy right up my alley","9915":"I will watch this movie over and over, and there is nothing you can do to stop me. SO THERE","9916":"It came right when it said it would and it's in great condition and was soooo funny. I recommend this for all.","9917":"This is good for about the first five minutes, and after that it becomes increasingly boring. The gags are too simplistic and obvious. And I like Monty Python!","9918":"This movie is the best out of all the movies they make! 1 place is this movie, second place is The Meaning of Life, third place is Life of Brian and fourth place is And Now for Something Completely Different! I know Life of Brian is on Blu-ray so I have high hopes to get it! Surprisingly that the Meaning of Life isn't on Blu-ray though I heard October 8, 2013 is suppose to be its release date!","9919":"Those English charlatans put together a reasonably coherent comedy about the quest for the Holy Grail. Still a lot of fun. Quite a few belly laughs, but also some seriously incoherent silliness. You either like Monty Python or you hate them. Me, I like them, but this movie is not for everybody.","9920":"This movie is one of my all time favorites and has humor like no other. You'll either love it or hate it but it's a must see movie! Fun for all and really funny!","9921":"I haven't seen this movie in close to 20 years. I looked all over town and not a single copy anywhere! Thanks to Amazon.com, I can watch it anywhere I can get a WiFi signal. If you like British comedy, you will love Monty Python and The Holy Grail!","9922":"Who doesn't love Monty Python and the Holy Grail?! Unless you have NO idea about Monty Python. Then maybe you wouldn't. But then you would be a turtle stuck under a rock. With giant fangs. Aaargh. Aarr.","9923":"how this movie got A high rating on some site, is beyond me, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT\nit was the dumbest movie I've ever seen, there were TWO discs, I ended up stopping the player and ejecting disc one","9924":"recently introduced my 6 & 8 year old sons to this beloved classic treasure!  we were busting our guts laughing! and still quoting lines from the movie months later!","9925":"Perfect! I am incredibly glad to get this.","9926":"If you loved this picture originally, and you're interested in background info, get this. Gilliam is hilarious and frank in his assessments. The picture quality is very very good, and the surround sound is awesome too. I disagree with Mr. Gilliam, in that many people will find this upgrade worthwhile. Yes, it is old material, and the methods are dated and\/or simplistic. But that is much of the charm. And now you can notice it all in high definition!","9927":"A beautiful BluRay transfer...the visual and audio elements are as crisp and clean as any Monty Python fan could ask for.\nYou may even find yourself discovering lines of dialogue that were unintelligible in other copies of the film.\nIt's also loaded with extras that will keep Python  fans busy for hours on end.\nIf you're a fan of Monty Python it's time you moved on up to this holy grail of \"The Holy Grail.\"","9928":"has to be they're best film EVER  laughs galore  great one liners (I use on occaision) excelent price for a true classic","9929":"I LOVED this flick in my high school days. I bought it when it was a good price to reminisce and turns out it's not as funny these days.","9930":"Top-Notch! The image quality is like night and day over my old VHS copy!  If you have an HDTV, this is one of those must-have movies in your collection.","9931":"The movie is as expected with slapstick humor. Always good for a laugh along the way. Fun for a group to watch.","9932":"On Blu-ray? their best movie-for less than a trip to McDonalds? Come on. Buy it already. You can't lose. You can sell it to anyone for this price.","9933":"This is such a classic I can't even tell you anything I dislike about it. Monty Python makes everything better.","9934":"British humor at its best or worse depending on your likes and dislikes of British humor if it can be called humor","9935":"This goes down as one of my all time favorite movies. As a History Teacher, I both appritiate the take and spin on some very \"Dark Ages\". I even show parts of this in my Early World History class every year because it is so good!","9937":"I think this is one of the funniest movies of all time. I got it at a good price and in a timely fashion","9938":"Seriously, who hasn't seen this movie. Buy it now and stop reading this. Stop that right now! There'll be none of that while I'm here.","9940":"I remember watching this movie at the drive inn. It's a good Monty Python movie. It's British humor at it's best.","9941":"Liked the stage version so much better.  Love British humour but this was even a wee bit bizarre for them.  Did not help that the case for the dvd did come damaged as well, could return but probably will give as a gift to someone who will enjoy more than I.  I would skip this and just enjoy on youtube.","9942":"Classic Classic Classic\nI got my kids to like this movie from the VHS version (i remember old fireside theater).\n\nhad to get the Blu ray version as our DVD had died (scratches from too many viewings and kids not putting it up correctly).\n\ndang this is still funny. the quality seems a bit better (only a flesh wound).\n\nyou can't go wrong with this movie. but as my wife says... its more a guys thing (except my daughter likes it).","9943":"The silliest version ever of Arthur and the knights of the Round Table looks great in Blu-ray. Nobody makes fun of English legends better!","9944":"Got to introduce it to my wife for the first time.. Always been a classic she said she loved everything but the ending.. I enjoy it all..","9945":"I've not seen this in awhile, but it is pure Monty Python if you don't know English(Brit) rumor, this is 101 to PHD","9946":"What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said.  It's got to be one of the funniest of all time.  I love most British\/English comedy, and this is near the tops.","9947":"Great movie. I could seriously watch it everyday. If you do not buy this movie I will be forced to say... \"Ni !!!!!\"","9948":"They made a legend of comedy in blu-ray, what could be better! This has so many extra features it is amazing! The clarity of the movie is breath taking! I am very happy with this purchase, and will hold on to this one. I am happy to see that they are making these older classic movies in bluray!","9949":"great for your 2 year old lego world is great for dexterity and all unisex yes maybe this that more","9951":"This is such a classic. I looked so many places before I found this on Amazon. I love having it on my pc 'cos there is nothing like Monty Python's humor and I never fail to fall into it an laugh like I'm watching it for the first time or I know every word by heart.","9952":"Purchased this for my son for Christmas - now we have a new Python fan in our midst. Excellent film - wonderful to find it on DVD!","9954":"Even though the movie was made many years ago and I have seen it many times, it is still makes me laugh.","9956":"My husband loved it. It's too funny! Well worth the entertainment value. It arrived way ahead of schedule, and in time for Christmas gift giving. It was well packed and arrived in good shape.","9957":"Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny. Funny. Classic British comedy troupe. Ahead of its time. Timeless comedy. Granted, not all the skits work, but the vast majority of them do and are HILARIOUS and so memorable and quotable.","9958":"I really hated this movie and am sorry I bought it. I tried to give it away to friends and family and they all said, \"No.\" I would like my money back...but it is opened...so I guess it goes to Salvation Army!","9959":"I love it. It made me laugh and think. I love English humor. If I am not dead yet, I will watch it again.","9961":"Perfect edition - I just wanted the dvd - for what else is there anyway?  I could say so much about the content of this film, so I won't say anything except you MUST buy it.","9962":"I bought this for my husband because it is his all time favorite movie. I was a little disappointed that when it came the DVD wasn't secured into the snap in the middle of the case. But it wasn't damaged or scratched and played beautifully. Funny as ever!","9963":"Really? Do I really need to write a review about Monty Python and The Holy Grail?! It's a spoof movie about knights and their quest for the Holy Grail. All these years my sisters and I have used lines from the movie. Now that my boys are teenagers and watched the movie, they finally understand what their Mom has been saying all the years...and discovered that she's actually funny. Monty Python. Watch it.","9965":"People said this was very funny but I did not like it all that much, so maybe its just me.","9966":"Many say only guys can appreciate this movie...However, it is the funniest movie ever produced in the history of the world.\n-Reviewed by a Guy","9967":"This is a classic movie that I love but I gave it two stars because the QUALITY of the video is substandard.. I would expect this from a bootleg site not from a legitimate site.  It will make me think twice about ordering another digital movie from here again.","9968":"This is a great movie, perfect for the times when you just want to watch something different!  When I saw that it was out on Bluray I had to add it to my collection.  Some people might say that the transfer to Bluray doesn't do it justice, but I think that all depends on the watchers tv, audio setup, and so many other factors.  It looked and sounded great on my setup!  I would recommend this to anyone who likes some old school comedy every once in a while.","9973":"This is the funniest movie ever... period.\n\nMy wife would not agree.  Maybe it's a guy-thing.\n\nHey Amazon - negative reviews from 12 years ago are not helpful. Can't you purge the reviews after so long?","9974":"Just the fact that this is Monty Python automaticaly means 5 stars! Being big Python fans, we got this to replace our old copy on VHS, plus this has all the extra goodies and much better picture quality.","9975":"Because this movie is explosive, this has to e one of the best commedies i've seen in a long time. this movie is up on my top ten best commedies ever made. this movie is silly and it is hillarious, just the way i like them. if you have not seen this movie yet then i recommend you do","9976":"As another reviewer wrote, it is a little difficult to remove the disc from the package.  Do you really NEED the script?  Probably not, but it's cool to have!","9977":"This moovie is stoopid, everyone who thincks its funnee is dumb, its so overrrated, nuthing is funy about it, just emmature garbaj. And its hestoricallee unaccurate. Adam Sandler and Pauly Shore is funnee, not thes junk.","9978":"This is actually a funny movie, even after all this time. Nothing seems outdated in the least. The print of the film is surprisingly clear, a step above the average 1970's comedy. They seem to have overdefined the term \"bonus content\" as there is some stuff that appears random, like the film in Lego mode! If you like British humor, than you should definitely see this movie, if you haven't already seen it, at this time. If you have seen it and liked it, this is the version to buy, for sure!","9980":"This is still to this day one of the finest, funniest movies ever made.  Im so happy they have it on pretty much any format.  Monty Python has a youtube channel now too.  Great stuff.","9982":"I purchased this dvd in hopes that it would come to my house before the weekend.  I placed the order on a Tuesday and received it on Thursday.  I was quite pleased with the product and have had no problems with the dvd.  It was a good purchase and I would buy from them again.","9985":"I don't agree with Python's overt anti-religious sentiments they present at times, but I still recommend the movie as the funniest movie ever written.  It's more for adults than children though.  I will never forget the first time I ever watched it.  I almost cried I laughed so hard.  It is a classic which to this day has never been matched for sheer originality and brilliant witty humor.","9986":"This entry in the King Arthur mythos plays more like a comedy. Set in England in 932 AD. It's just a flesh wound...","9991":"this box set is just,wonderful.full of surprises and with the additional disc choke full of info.\na very funny movie,but what else would you expect from the pythons.\nclassic skits,brave black knight-only a scratch-brilliant.\nif you can get this box set you will not be disappointed.but if you can't get the movie it's great.","9992":"Monty Python and the Holy Grail was the first feature length work of the great comedy team Monty Python.  The result is a treasure of wit.  I have seen this film many times and it never fails to entertain me.  It certainly holds up with time and repeated viewings.","9993":"There's a reason that this movie is legend: it's an outstandingly creative endeavor rendered in spare, clean segments.  The humour is rich and the acting superb.  View it: you won't be disappointed!","9995":"I haven't seen this movie in quite some time and it hasn't lost a thing. Halarious!","9996":"The Bottom Line:\n\nRomanced all out of proportion, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has its funny and effective moments but quickly runs out of steam and creativity; many people like it but it's certainly no great movie.","9998":"Monty Python, alone is more fun than whip cream on a oreo cookie. I love this movie. One of the best fun movies of all time. Worth watching over & over again. The quest to find \"The Holy Grail\",a killer rabbit,the black knight, the knights of \"Nee\" & more.  You must ask,can theses knight show valor & glory?Great fun & just great comedy movie trip. Enjoy the fun kids,I did."},"summary":{"0":"Amazing!","1":"Great Gospel VHS of the Cathedrals!","2":"A great document of a great band","7":"Love it","8":"Three Stars","9":"Blast from the past","10":"Excellent Viewing","11":"Four Stars","12":"Five Stars","13":"A great read.
